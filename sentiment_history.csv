If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T21:43:55.826673,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T21:48:07.005664,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T23:33:44.635529,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2507.44
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000.</p><h2>Ether price prediction</h2><p>Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ETH</a>) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-61bc-7d39-bd5b-750329f3af99"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>ETH/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000.</p><p>The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111.

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA.

If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31.&nbsp;</p><p>If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19).

If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.</p><p>On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.</p><h2>Cosmos price prediction</h2><p>Cosmos (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/cosmos-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ATOM</a>) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T23:45:11.466012,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2502.97
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA.

This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T23:52:10.841044,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2507.17
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000.</p><h2>Ether price prediction</h2><p>Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ETH</a>) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-61bc-7d39-bd5b-750329f3af99"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>ETH/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000.</p><p>The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111.

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA.

That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31.&nbsp;</p><p>If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19).

If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.</p><p>On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.</p><h2>Cosmos price prediction</h2><p>Cosmos (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/cosmos-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ATOM</a>) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T00:18:54.749034,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2520.85
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA.

This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T00:45:11.155849,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2533.9
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000.</p><h2>Ether price prediction</h2><p>Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ETH</a>) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-61bc-7d39-bd5b-750329f3af99"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>ETH/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000.</p><p>The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111.

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA.

If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31.&nbsp;</p><p>If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19).

If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.</p><p>On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.</p><h2>Cosmos price prediction</h2><p>Cosmos (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/cosmos-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ATOM</a>) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T00:53:23.838543,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2530.4
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA.

This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T01:42:27.516810,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2503.38
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000.</p><h2>Ether price prediction</h2><p>Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ETH</a>) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-61bc-7d39-bd5b-750329f3af99"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>ETH/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000.</p><p>The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111.

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA.

If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31.&nbsp;</p><p>If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19).

If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.</p><p>On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.</p><h2>Cosmos price prediction</h2><p>Cosmos (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/cosmos-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ATOM</a>) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T01:45:12.353342,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2503.15
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA.

This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.  Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.  In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH’s long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity  Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.  The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next’s resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.  If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,🤝 Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T02:21:13.994613,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/,2514.6
News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum.

If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it’s ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‘digital gold.’ If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders.

Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) – Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‑owned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony Pompliano&#8217;s podcast on May 8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5 Million TRUMP Tokens On The Move—Trump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening 👇 pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10 trillion, $20 trillion or even $30 trillion or investing $500 million or $1 billion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn’t sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around — is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold — What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly — although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD — the ‘Short Liquidations USD’ metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.  Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock’s reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH’s trading volume surpassed BTC’s volume for the first time in years.  Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH’s future potential. “In just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,” the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin’s impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone – $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin’s push above $100K and Ethereum’s explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back – 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot—the underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana’s technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point—either igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana’s current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation—if momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation – Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply – Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180–$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.  According to Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.  The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin’s MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst’s chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.  Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.</em></p><h2>Ways to earn yield on Bitcoin</h2><p>While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"">bridging</a> BTC to other blockchains.</p><h3>Centralized lending platforms</h3><p>Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"">collapse of firms</a> like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability.&nbsp;</p><h3>WBTC on Ethereum</h3><p>WBTC is an <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"">ERC-20 token</a> backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo).

This unlocks DeFi&rsquo;s potential but introduces risks from BitGo&rsquo;s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.</p><h3>Bitcoin layer-2 platforms</h3><p>Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin&rsquo;s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after &ldquo;the Merge,&rdquo; replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain&rsquo;s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.</em></p><h2>How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform</h2><p>Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.</p><p>Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.</p></li></ul><p>Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.</p><figure><img alt=""Stake BTC on Binance Earn"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36c-448c-7d76-b618-b502aba3d789"" title="""" /></figure><p>After subscribing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term&rsquo;s end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.</p></li></ul><p>Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.</p><h2>How to earn yield with WBTC on Ethereum</h2><p>WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum&rsquo;s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"">liquidity pools</a> and earning interest or fees.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Convert BTC to WBTC:</strong> Use a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"">centralized exchange (CEX)</a> (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transfer WBTC to a wallet:</strong> Move WBTC to a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"">Web3</a> wallet like <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"">MetaMask</a> and make sure you have enough Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"">gas fees</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect to a DeFi protocol:</strong> Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform&rsquo;s interface.</p></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Connect your wallet to Aave platform"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36d-bb40-714c-bdc9-e4ff139bd2fc"" title="""" /></figure><ul><li><p><strong>Earn yield:</strong> By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.</p></li></ul><h2>How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2s</h2><p>Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon&rsquo;s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with Babylon:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up a compatible wallet:</strong> Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses.

Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em> <em>In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.</em></p><h2>Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocols</h2><p>Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security.</p><h3>Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol</h3><p>Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.</p><h3>Stacking in the Stacks Protocol</h3><p>Stacking is Stacks&rsquo; yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"">STX</a>) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.</p><h2>Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained</h2><p>Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"">deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns</a> for institutional investors outside the US.&nbsp;</p><p>The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"">spot and futures markets</a>, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting annual net returns of 4&ndash;8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin &mdash; an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Risks involved in earning yield with BTC</h2><p>Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Custodial risk:</strong> Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC&rsquo;s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network maturity:</strong> Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market risk:</strong> Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>How earning yield with BTC may evolve</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin&rsquo;s censorship resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful—but narrowly targeted—thesis: Bitcoin’s institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is “the fastest horse” toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum’s investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto’s longest-lived touchstones. “It’s become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,” he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented “headline-driven market.” Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are “hoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,” but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once “local maxima” on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap “If Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It’s more about the flows.” Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a “fraction of the market cap of gold,” now trades in an environment where gold’s 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion “simply because it’s easier to transport and censorship-resistant.” The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone—particularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann’s 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network’s throughput during last month’s Trump-branded meme-coin launch—“the chain did not suffer; it hummed right along”—as a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. “When the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.” Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that “given the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows… Solana’s got to be at least $420,” a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann’s hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now “being cannibalized by its own L2s.” With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers—criteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. “The asset is not worth owning,” he concluded. “Anytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.” McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate “alt-season” that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with “real protocol revenue, not just governance.” If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don’t, “most of them will trade to zero.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles – Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations.

Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US–China trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin’s trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here’s what we predict:  Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC’s long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin’s dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance – the measure of BTC’s share of the total cryptocurrency market – tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers. This could accelerate Ethereum&rsquo;s roadmap for privacy and scalability via ZK rollups, making RISC-V a compelling complement to the EVM.</p><p>Below is a comparison table summarizing the key differences and benefits of RISC-V vs. the EVM.</p><p><img alt=""EVM vs. RISC-V"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/cf9f765427104790f7f32cf20ce3033e.jpg"" title=""EVM vs. RISC-V"" /></p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum has gone through several major development milestones over its first decade.

It is an ambitious idea that could be a milestone in the development roadmap for the leading smart contract blockchain.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Programmer Ben Adams raised several concerns about the proposal: In short, the ZK-proof might become more efficient, but there could be a trade-off. Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,&rdquo; commented Ben Adams.</p><p>A sentiment that was <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617/7"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoed</a> by another anonymous commenter, &ldquo;I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.&rdquo;</p><p>Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-5-772078-20250422"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">added</a> Adam Cochran.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-layers-of-blockchain-technology"">layer-1 blockchain</a> works.</p><p>Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn&rsquo;t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin&rsquo;s proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.</p>                    </div></div>

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful—but narrowly targeted—thesis: Bitcoin’s institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is “the fastest horse” toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum’s investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto’s longest-lived touchstones. “It’s become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,” he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented “headline-driven market.” Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are “hoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,” but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once “local maxima” on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap “If Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars.

Bitcoin, still a “fraction of the market cap of gold,” now trades in an environment where gold’s 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion “simply because it’s easier to transport and censorship-resistant.” The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone—particularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposal.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin’s muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world’s best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin—known online as Kev Capital TA—answered with an unequivocal “yes,” pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? “Can Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,” Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, “well above a dollar,” he noted, while stressing that citing the level is “not a price call” but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin’s conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. “We hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,” he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. “Look how much room we have to go.” A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin’s prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic “alt-season.” “Altcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin… monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,” he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a “perfect inverse head-and-shoulders” accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15—now “up 65–70%”—and set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance “durably” breaks down. “Realistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy… we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,” he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Looks Incredible Here,’ Says Crypto Analyst — Here’s Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin’s 2021 spike—fueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk’s “Saturday Night Live” appearance—as a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is “nowhere near crossing,” implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, “won’t even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,” leaving a notional 145% cushion between today’s price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that “we’re here to make money, we’re not here to get attached,” he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. “We’re not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video… This is a video based on facts,” he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally – Why $1 Is Still In The Cards. The Dogecoin price has seen a major rebound recently, which has brought it above the $0.23 resistance over the weekend. This upward move looks to have been sustained as buyers have regained power over the market in the last week. Despite the already notable rally that the meme coin has enjoyed recently, expectations remain that it will continue to rise higher, with crypto analysts predicting an explosive rally for the altcoin. Dogecoin Price Remains Very Bullish Pseudonymous crypto analyst MMBTtrader on the TradingView website has outlined that the Dogecoin price remains highly bullish. The current pump is expected to continue as Dogecoin has yet to hit any major resistance, thus setting it on a path to possibly double. Related Reading: Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach? As the crypto analyst points out, the Dogecoin price could likely see a correction after rising so much recently. However, this is expected to only be short-term and would, in fact, fuel the rally and serve as a bounce-off point for further rallies. This corruption could happen just below $0.25. However, the analyst does point out that with the Dogecoin price being so bullish, it is possible that it rises higher than this level before the correction happens. Presently, the only thing holding the Dogecoin price back is the trend line outlined in red in the analyst’s chart. This serves as a deciding point for the meme coin, and a break above it is expected to push the price forward. In this case, the crypto analyst expects it to rise as high as $0.4. Additionally, they add that if it breaks above $0.4, it would signal an extremely bullish market, pushing the Dogecoin price toward $0.75, and then $1. On the other hand, though, a failure to break above the trend line could signal the beginning of bearish pressure. As the chart shows, the first bearish stop would be at $0.13548. Further downtrend could then send it below $0.1 to $0.09024. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target DOGE Still Shooting For $1 Another crypto analyst has also suggested that the Dogecoin price could be heading for the $1 target. They explain that after the strong bounce of the $0.14 support, Dogecoin is now showing signs of a bullish reversal on the weekly timeframe. This casts a wider net for targets for the meme coin’s price as the uptrend plays out. From here, the crypto analyst explains that if the Dogecoin price can hold, then the next main target is $1. For this to happen, though, volume confirmation and how the price performs in the next few weeks are crucial. “DOGE might just be gearing up for another historic run,” the analyst said.

These methods often involve using third-party platforms or <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"">bridging</a> BTC to other blockchains.</p><h3>Centralized lending platforms</h3><p>Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"">collapse of firms</a> like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability.&nbsp;</p><h3>WBTC on Ethereum</h3><p>WBTC is an <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"">ERC-20 token</a> backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo). It enables BTC holders to engage in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, such as lending on Aave, <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchange-liquidity-and-why-it-matters-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchange-liquidity-and-why-it-matters-explained"">providing liquidity</a> on Curve or yield farming. This unlocks DeFi&rsquo;s potential but introduces risks from BitGo&rsquo;s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.</p><h3>Bitcoin layer-2 platforms</h3><p>Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin&rsquo;s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after &ldquo;the Merge,&rdquo; replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain&rsquo;s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.</em></p><h2>How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform</h2><p>Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.</p><p>Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.</p></li></ul><p>Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.</p><figure><img alt=""Stake BTC on Binance Earn"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36c-448c-7d76-b618-b502aba3d789"" title="""" /></figure><p>After subscribing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term&rsquo;s end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.</p></li></ul><p>Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.</p><h2>How to earn yield with WBTC on Ethereum</h2><p>WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum&rsquo;s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"">liquidity pools</a> and earning interest or fees.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Convert BTC to WBTC:</strong> Use a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"">centralized exchange (CEX)</a> (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transfer WBTC to a wallet:</strong> Move WBTC to a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"">Web3</a> wallet like <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"">MetaMask</a> and make sure you have enough Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"">gas fees</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect to a DeFi protocol:</strong> Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform&rsquo;s interface.</p></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Connect your wallet to Aave platform"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36d-bb40-714c-bdc9-e4ff139bd2fc"" title="""" /></figure><ul><li><p><strong>Earn yield:</strong> By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.</p></li></ul><h2>How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2s</h2><p>Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon&rsquo;s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with Babylon:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up a compatible wallet:</strong> Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses.

Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.</em></p><h2>Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocols</h2><p>Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security.</p><h3>Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol</h3><p>Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.</p><h3>Stacking in the Stacks Protocol</h3><p>Stacking is Stacks&rsquo; yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"">STX</a>) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.</p><h2>Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained</h2><p>Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"">deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns</a> for institutional investors outside the US.&nbsp;</p><p>The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"">spot and futures markets</a>, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting annual net returns of 4&ndash;8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin &mdash; an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Risks involved in earning yield with BTC</h2><p>Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Custodial risk:</strong> Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC&rsquo;s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network maturity:</strong> Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market risk:</strong> Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>How earning yield with BTC may evolve</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin&rsquo;s censorship resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful—but narrowly targeted—thesis: Bitcoin’s institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is “the fastest horse” toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum’s investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto’s longest-lived touchstones. “It’s become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,” he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented “headline-driven market.” Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are “hoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,” but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once “local maxima” on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap “If Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It’s more about the flows.” Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a “fraction of the market cap of gold,” now trades in an environment where gold’s 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion “simply because it’s easier to transport and censorship-resistant.” The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone—particularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann’s 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network’s throughput during last month’s Trump-branded meme-coin launch—“the chain did not suffer; it hummed right along”—as a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. “When the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.” Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that “given the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows… Solana’s got to be at least $420,” a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann’s hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now “being cannibalized by its own L2s.” With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers—criteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. “The asset is not worth owning,” he concluded. “Anytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.” McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate “alt-season” that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with “real protocol revenue, not just governance.” If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don’t, “most of them will trade to zero.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles – Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations.

Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs.

Regulators would catch any large cross-border payments made in crypto. There has not been a reported case of governments turning to Bitcoin in order to sidestep duties. Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone. Some pattern observers claim an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders configuration could develop. 💰 $BTC Market Update#Bitcoin is currently testing the Weekly Supply Zone around $105,000 👀 🧠 The most likely scenario is a rejection from this level, leading to the formation of an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders pattern — a setup that could create space for a mini #altseason 📈… pic.twitter.com/aLSPi5qhuq — Rose Premium Signals 🌹 (@VipRoseTr) May 11, 2025 That pattern requires two distinct shoulders and a lower trough in the middle. Currently, the swings have been unbalanced, muddying the image. A rejection might be followed by a brief period of altcoin accumulation before Bitcoin takes off again where it left off.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US–China trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin’s trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here’s what we predict:  Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC’s long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin’s dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance – the measure of BTC’s share of the total cryptocurrency market – tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful—but narrowly targeted—thesis: Bitcoin’s institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is “the fastest horse” toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum’s investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto’s longest-lived touchstones. “It’s become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,” he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented “headline-driven market.” Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are “hoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,” but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once “local maxima” on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap “If Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It’s more about the flows.” Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a “fraction of the market cap of gold,” now trades in an environment where gold’s 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion “simply because it’s easier to transport and censorship-resistant.” The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone—particularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann’s 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network’s throughput during last month’s Trump-branded meme-coin launch—“the chain did not suffer; it hummed right along”—as a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. “When the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.” Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that “given the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows… Solana’s got to be at least $420,” a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann’s hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now “being cannibalized by its own L2s.” With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers—criteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. “The asset is not worth owning,” he concluded. “Anytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.” McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate “alt-season” that characterised prior tops.

News,Solana,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful—but narrowly targeted—thesis: Bitcoin’s institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is “the fastest horse” toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum’s investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto’s longest-lived touchstones. “It’s become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,” he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented “headline-driven market.” Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are “hoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,” but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once “local maxima” on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap “If Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It’s more about the flows.” Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a “fraction of the market cap of gold,” now trades in an environment where gold’s 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion “simply because it’s easier to transport and censorship-resistant.” The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone—particularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann’s 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network’s throughput during last month’s Trump-branded meme-coin launch—“the chain did not suffer; it hummed right along”—as a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. “When the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.” Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that “given the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows… Solana’s got to be at least $420,” a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann’s hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now “being cannibalized by its own L2s.” With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers—criteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. “The asset is not worth owning,” he concluded. “Anytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.” McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate “alt-season” that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin’s muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world’s best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin—known online as Kev Capital TA—answered with an unequivocal “yes,” pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? “Can Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,” Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, “well above a dollar,” he noted, while stressing that citing the level is “not a price call” but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin’s conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. “We hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,” he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. “Look how much room we have to go.” A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin’s prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic “alt-season.” “Altcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin… monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,” he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a “perfect inverse head-and-shoulders” accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15—now “up 65–70%”—and set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance “durably” breaks down. “Realistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy… we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,” he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Looks Incredible Here,’ Says Crypto Analyst — Here’s Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin’s 2021 spike—fueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk’s “Saturday Night Live” appearance—as a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is “nowhere near crossing,” implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, “won’t even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,” leaving a notional 145% cushion between today’s price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that “we’re here to make money, we’re not here to get attached,” he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. “We’re not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video… This is a video based on facts,” he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally – Why $1 Is Still In The Cards. The Dogecoin price has seen a major rebound recently, which has brought it above the $0.23 resistance over the weekend. This upward move looks to have been sustained as buyers have regained power over the market in the last week. Despite the already notable rally that the meme coin has enjoyed recently, expectations remain that it will continue to rise higher, with crypto analysts predicting an explosive rally for the altcoin. Dogecoin Price Remains Very Bullish Pseudonymous crypto analyst MMBTtrader on the TradingView website has outlined that the Dogecoin price remains highly bullish. The current pump is expected to continue as Dogecoin has yet to hit any major resistance, thus setting it on a path to possibly double. Related Reading: Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach? As the crypto analyst points out, the Dogecoin price could likely see a correction after rising so much recently. However, this is expected to only be short-term and would, in fact, fuel the rally and serve as a bounce-off point for further rallies. This corruption could happen just below $0.25. However, the analyst does point out that with the Dogecoin price being so bullish, it is possible that it rises higher than this level before the correction happens. Presently, the only thing holding the Dogecoin price back is the trend line outlined in red in the analyst’s chart. This serves as a deciding point for the meme coin, and a break above it is expected to push the price forward. In this case, the crypto analyst expects it to rise as high as $0.4. Additionally, they add that if it breaks above $0.4, it would signal an extremely bullish market, pushing the Dogecoin price toward $0.75, and then $1. On the other hand, though, a failure to break above the trend line could signal the beginning of bearish pressure. As the chart shows, the first bearish stop would be at $0.13548. Further downtrend could then send it below $0.1 to $0.09024. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target DOGE Still Shooting For $1 Another crypto analyst has also suggested that the Dogecoin price could be heading for the $1 target. They explain that after the strong bounce of the $0.14 support, Dogecoin is now showing signs of a bullish reversal on the weekly timeframe. This casts a wider net for targets for the meme coin’s price as the uptrend plays out. From here, the crypto analyst explains that if the Dogecoin price can hold, then the next main target is $1. For this to happen, though, volume confirmation and how the price performs in the next few weeks are crucial. “DOGE might just be gearing up for another historic run,” the analyst said.

The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.</em></p><h2>Ways to earn yield on Bitcoin</h2><p>While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"">bridging</a> BTC to other blockchains.</p><h3>Centralized lending platforms</h3><p>Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure.

This unlocks DeFi&rsquo;s potential but introduces risks from BitGo&rsquo;s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.</p><h3>Bitcoin layer-2 platforms</h3><p>Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin&rsquo;s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after &ldquo;the Merge,&rdquo; replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain&rsquo;s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.</em></p><h2>How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform</h2><p>Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.</p><p>Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.</p></li></ul><p>Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.</p><figure><img alt=""Stake BTC on Binance Earn"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36c-448c-7d76-b618-b502aba3d789"" title="""" /></figure><p>After subscribing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term&rsquo;s end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts.

Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security.</p><h3>Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol</h3><p>Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.</p><h3>Stacking in the Stacks Protocol</h3><p>Stacking is Stacks&rsquo; yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"">STX</a>) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.</p><h2>Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained</h2><p>Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"">deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns</a> for institutional investors outside the US.&nbsp;</p><p>The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"">spot and futures markets</a>, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting annual net returns of 4&ndash;8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin &mdash; an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Risks involved in earning yield with BTC</h2><p>Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Custodial risk:</strong> Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC&rsquo;s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network maturity:</strong> Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market risk:</strong> Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>How earning yield with BTC may evolve</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin&rsquo;s censorship resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful—but narrowly targeted—thesis: Bitcoin’s institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is “the fastest horse” toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum’s investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto’s longest-lived touchstones. “It’s become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,” he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented “headline-driven market.” Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are “hoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,” but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once “local maxima” on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap “If Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It’s more about the flows.” Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a “fraction of the market cap of gold,” now trades in an environment where gold’s 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion “simply because it’s easier to transport and censorship-resistant.” The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone—particularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann’s 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network’s throughput during last month’s Trump-branded meme-coin launch—“the chain did not suffer; it hummed right along”—as a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. “When the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.” Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that “given the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows… Solana’s got to be at least $420,” a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann’s hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now “being cannibalized by its own L2s.” With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers—criteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. “The asset is not worth owning,” he concluded. “Anytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.” McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate “alt-season” that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with “real protocol revenue, not just governance.” If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don’t, “most of them will trade to zero.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles – Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Bitcoin Outpaces Stocks According to reports, the S&#38;P 500 declined almost 1% during April, but Bitcoin rose. Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April.

Regulators would catch any large cross-border payments made in crypto. There has not been a reported case of governments turning to Bitcoin in order to sidestep duties. Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone. Some pattern observers claim an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders configuration could develop. 💰 $BTC Market Update#Bitcoin is currently testing the Weekly Supply Zone around $105,000 👀 🧠 The most likely scenario is a rejection from this level, leading to the formation of an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders pattern — a setup that could create space for a mini #altseason 📈… pic.twitter.com/aLSPi5qhuq — Rose Premium Signals 🌹 (@VipRoseTr) May 11, 2025 That pattern requires two distinct shoulders and a lower trough in the middle.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US–China trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin’s trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here’s what we predict:  Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC’s long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin’s dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance – the measure of BTC’s share of the total cryptocurrency market – tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful—but narrowly targeted—thesis: Bitcoin’s institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is “the fastest horse” toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum’s investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto’s longest-lived touchstones. “It’s become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,” he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented “headline-driven market.” Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are “hoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,” but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once “local maxima” on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here’s The Roadmap “If Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It’s more about the flows.” Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a “fraction of the market cap of gold,” now trades in an environment where gold’s 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion “simply because it’s easier to transport and censorship-resistant.” The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone—particularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann’s 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network’s throughput during last month’s Trump-branded meme-coin launch—“the chain did not suffer; it hummed right along”—as a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. “When the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.” Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that “given the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows… Solana’s got to be at least $420,” a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann’s hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now “being cannibalized by its own L2s.” With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers—criteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. “The asset is not worth owning,” he concluded. “Anytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.” McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate “alt-season” that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with “real protocol revenue, not just governance.” If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don’t, “most of them will trade to zero.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Tokens in between must now defend themselves with “real protocol revenue, not just governance.” If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don’t, “most of them will trade to zero.” At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin’s muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world’s best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin—known online as Kev Capital TA—answered with an unequivocal “yes,” pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? “Can Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,” Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, “well above a dollar,” he noted, while stressing that citing the level is “not a price call” but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin’s conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. “We hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,” he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. “Look how much room we have to go.” A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin’s prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic “alt-season.” “Altcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin… monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,” he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a “perfect inverse head-and-shoulders” accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15—now “up 65–70%”—and set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance “durably” breaks down. “Realistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy… we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,” he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Looks Incredible Here,’ Says Crypto Analyst — Here’s Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin’s 2021 spike—fueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk’s “Saturday Night Live” appearance—as a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is “nowhere near crossing,” implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, “won’t even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,” leaving a notional 145% cushion between today’s price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that “we’re here to make money, we’re not here to get attached,” he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. “We’re not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video… This is a video based on facts,” he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally – Why $1 Is Still In The Cards. The Dogecoin price has seen a major rebound recently, which has brought it above the $0.23 resistance over the weekend. This upward move looks to have been sustained as buyers have regained power over the market in the last week. Despite the already notable rally that the meme coin has enjoyed recently, expectations remain that it will continue to rise higher, with crypto analysts predicting an explosive rally for the altcoin. Dogecoin Price Remains Very Bullish Pseudonymous crypto analyst MMBTtrader on the TradingView website has outlined that the Dogecoin price remains highly bullish. The current pump is expected to continue as Dogecoin has yet to hit any major resistance, thus setting it on a path to possibly double. Related Reading: Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach? As the crypto analyst points out, the Dogecoin price could likely see a correction after rising so much recently. However, this is expected to only be short-term and would, in fact, fuel the rally and serve as a bounce-off point for further rallies. This corruption could happen just below $0.25. However, the analyst does point out that with the Dogecoin price being so bullish, it is possible that it rises higher than this level before the correction happens. Presently, the only thing holding the Dogecoin price back is the trend line outlined in red in the analyst’s chart. This serves as a deciding point for the meme coin, and a break above it is expected to push the price forward. In this case, the crypto analyst expects it to rise as high as $0.4. Additionally, they add that if it breaks above $0.4, it would signal an extremely bullish market, pushing the Dogecoin price toward $0.75, and then $1. On the other hand, though, a failure to break above the trend line could signal the beginning of bearish pressure. As the chart shows, the first bearish stop would be at $0.13548. Further downtrend could then send it below $0.1 to $0.09024. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‘Easy’ Target DOGE Still Shooting For $1 Another crypto analyst has also suggested that the Dogecoin price could be heading for the $1 target. They explain that after the strong bounce of the $0.14 support, Dogecoin is now showing signs of a bullish reversal on the weekly timeframe. This casts a wider net for targets for the meme coin’s price as the uptrend plays out. From here, the crypto analyst explains that if the Dogecoin price can hold, then the next main target is $1. For this to happen, though, volume confirmation and how the price performs in the next few weeks are crucial. “DOGE might just be gearing up for another historic run,” the analyst said.
