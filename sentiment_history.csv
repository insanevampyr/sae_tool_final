If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking.

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation ‚Äì Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing. Our articles, including this one, are not supposed to be financial¬†advice.",0.18,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T18:49:15.773837,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-bitcoin-nears-all-time-high-after-progressive-us-china-trade-talks/
News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T18:49:17.487335,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation ‚Äì Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23.

However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2.

DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T19:22:34.777958,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds.

Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA.

This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T19:29:47.311278,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation ‚Äì Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23.

If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum.

If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T19:34:40.491579,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation ‚Äì Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T19:56:53.950888,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds.

Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA.

This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T20:01:23.135750,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation ‚Äì Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23.

However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The rally has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone, suggesting a correction or consolidation in the near term. Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time.

Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality. This is similar to coins like $MOODENG and $BROCCOLI, two of the greatest meme coin stories in recent times. Given that $MOONPIG is fresh off the oven, there&#8217;s a high chance it could rally even more, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now. DYOR Before Buying the Best Altcoins Finally, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that even though a Bitcoin bull run looks imminent, this market is infamous for its volatility, meaning outlooks could change at any time. We recommend that our readers exercise caution and only invest an amount that&#8217;s small enough for them. Also, kindly do your own research before investing.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T20:14:38.096111,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation ‚Äì Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Volume has picked up significantly over the last few days, indicating rising interest and participation from traders. This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23.

If it does, let&rsquo;s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-57b1-7bbc-b52c-c556b7df5432"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT daily chart.

Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c054-5cac-7754-a2d7-ff3cd0f1184a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>BTC/USDT 4-hour chart.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum.

If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.&nbsp;</p><p>A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Altcoins to Buy as Bitcoin Nears All-Time High After Progressive US-China Trade Talks. Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed the $100K mark and is now trading around $104K. This sharp move is reportedly driven by easing tariff tensions and potential agreements between countries like the US and China. Trump took to Truth Social to say that a lot of things were discussed between the two countries and a constructive total reset is in sight. The POTUS also hinted at the possibility of opening up China to American business. Markets perceived this as a positive development and held the gains made in Bitcoin during the last 14 days. Read on as we discuss the reasons behind the recent surge in $BTC. We&#8217;ll also mention the best altcoins you can buy now to benefit from the upcoming Bitcoin push. Bitcoin Making Fundamental Gains Bitcoin has surged around 22% in the last 20 days and is just 4% away from its all-time high. Analysts believe that this gain is not just a speculative and reactive move but a fundamental gain. The FED has said that it‚Äôs ready to cut rates if needed without any inflationary pressure. With easing inflation and a stable economy, a neutral-to-dovish FED is a positive sign for assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin exchange balances are also declining, which means investors are withdrawing the asset to store in cold wallets. Funding rates are neutral with no clear bias on either side. This means that the price action is not skewed by speculative bets. Open interest, although high, is not frothy. This means that there&#8217;s active participation in the Bitcoin derivative market without any speculative bubble. High open interest during times of neutral funding rates indicates discipline and conviction-driven participation. This suggests that real capital is being invested in $BTC, leading to massive fundamental gains. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin ETF market also remained hot during the last week, with four positive trading days and a net positive inflow of $920M. Increasing Corporate Adoption Apart from this, we&#8217;re seeing rapid Bitcoin adoption by corporations and governments. Companies like Strategy hold more than 550,000K $BTC, whereas MARA Holdings also has around 47K $BTC. Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald launched a new investment vehicle company, Twenty One, with the aim of buying around 42K $BTC. Following this, several similar initiatives have been launched. For example, Strive Asset Management, backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, shared its plan to merge with Asset Entities to form a publicly traded company, BTC Treasury Company. Similarly, BTC INC. CEO David Bailey formed a new Bitcoin investment firm called Nakamoto, raising $300M. Such a push towards a Bitcoin reserve economy is a huge positive for the underlying asset, i.e., Bitcoin. Plus, it reflects the markets&#8217; belief in Bitcoin as the ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô If you, too, want to make the most out of this bull run, here are a few new cryptos you can invest in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Altcoin to Buy Right Now Although a Bitcoin bull run typically results in a thriving crypto market, where several meme coins see one green day after another, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out as the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ONLY crypto to offer real (and free) $BTC to its token holders. Unlike other cryptos that offer more of their own tokens for free in their airdrops, BTC Bull Token will send out actual $BTC to its owners. So long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet, you&#8217;ll automatically receive your share of $BTC every time the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Like the best meme coins, BTC Bull Token, too, will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be eliminated from the total supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on. Furthermore, the developers have reserved a chunky 40% of the total budget for promotional activities. This is another reason why we&#8217;ve predicted that $BTCBULL could jump 380% and reach $0.096 by 2026. BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, where it has raised over $5.5M so far. You can get each token for just $0.002505. Here&#8217;s a full explainer on how to buy it. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) ‚Äì New AI Agent Coin Offering Real-Time Crypto Investment Insights As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally would result in an overall bullish crypto market. However, even with rising prices across the board, it&#8217;d be difficult to identify the next cryptos to explode. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that&#8217;s built to have its finger on the pulse of the dynamic meme coin market in order to identify the best cryptos to invest in in real time. Essentially, this AI agent will interact with the crypto community on online platforms like X and record their crypto-related opinions. After tracking social trends and market sentiments, MIND of Pepe will use its hive-mind analysis to dish out real-time crypto investment advice to its token holders. Additionally, $MIND token holders will get early-bird access to the cryptos created by the AI agent. These tokens would be inspired by prevalent social trends and hype. Plus, they&#8217;ll also benefit from $MIND&#8217;s growing popularity in the crypto space. Buy $MIND today and become an early investor in the best AI agent coin. Each token is currently available for only $0.0037515, and the project has in total¬†raised¬†$9M. 3. Moonpig ($MOONPIG) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Currently in Its Early Stages Moonpig is a new low cap coin that has been dominating the top gainers list for the last few days. The token launched on the Solana blockchain on May 6 and has already posted gains of over 650%. $MOONPIG is currently trading at $0.03390, having risen by more than 40% in the last 24 hours alone. It&#8217;s worth noting that $MOONPIG has no inherent value and only thrives on community engagement and virality.

News,Bitcoin,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Coup: Wealth Funds Build Up Holdings. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to dabble in Bitcoin, but massive bets remain on hold. State‚Äëowned funds won&#8217;t go big, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has said, until the United States sets out with certainty how digital assets will be part of its financial system. He spoke on Anthony‚ÄØPompliano&#8217;s podcast on May‚ÄØ8, and it is only a matter of waiting. Related Reading: 3.5‚ÄØMillion TRUMP Tokens On The Move‚ÄîTrump Team Makes A Big Play Anticipation For US Regulation Scaramucci averred that unless US lawmakers provide strong direction, big-ticket purchases by sovereign funds will not happen. He cited the regulation of stablecoins, guidance on bank custody of tokens and pilot programs for tokenized stocks as the pieces missing from the puzzle. If Congress enacts a stablecoin bill this year and regulators detail how banks may hold Bitcoin and other tokens, those funds will be comfortable enough to move out of small, tactical trades. Sovereign wealth funds and institutions are quietly buying bitcoin.@scaramucci explains what is happening üëá pic.twitter.com/mDLmyE8iaL ‚Äî Anthony Pompliano üå™ (@APompliano) May 9, 2025 Existing Allocations Remain Modest According to reports, the majority of sovereign funds have maintained their Bitcoin holdings small. Norway&#8217;s sovereign fund, the globe&#8217;s largest with around $1.73 trillion under administration, and China&#8217;s $1.33 trillion pool have only made insignificant purchases up to now. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is close to $2.05 trillion. At this size, even a $100 million transaction would hardly make the charts wobble. This degree of restraint illustrates how careful these investors are. Legal Steps Could Unlock Demand If banks are allowed to custody digital assets, and tokenized stocks and bonds begin trading on regulated exchanges, Scaramucci anticipates a change. He&#8217;s previously spoken of &#8220;large blocks&#8221; of sovereign wealth funds that will be holding $10‚ÄØtrillion, $20‚ÄØtrillion or even $30‚ÄØtrillion or investing $500‚ÄØmillion or $1‚ÄØbillion orders. When those blocks are released into the market, price fluctuations may be dramatic. Executing an order of that magnitude in a narrow trading window would drive values higher quickly. Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Outlook For Price Movements There are some analysts who believe that Bitcoin crosses new milestones. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood stated in February that seven-figure prices in 2030 are more feasible now due to increased interest among large institutions. If sovereign funds approach Bitcoin as merely another asset class, with each new wave of demand further restricting available supply, it can pave the way for a race that many investors only fantasize about today. The path forward can still turn and curve. Scaramucci has proposed a crypto bill in America by November, but Washington&#8217;s timeline can fall behind. Europe and some of Asia are meanwhile operating pilot schemes for tokenized assets and building sandboxes for stablecoins. Those tests may entice some sovereign players earlier. Deep pockets are currently waiting, watching for a definite sign before they put their largest wagers.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation. The Bitcoin price couldn‚Äôt sustain the bullish momentum after its ascent to the current all-time-high price of $108,786 in January, leading to a crash to around $74,000 in the following months. However, the premier cryptocurrency appears to have roared back to life. Even as the Bitcoin price sits comfortably above the important six-figure threshold, an important question sticks around ‚Äî is the bullish run truly back on? Recent on-chain analysis suggests that the market leader might be preparing to resume its bull run. Binance Witnesses Largest Shorts Liquidation Since April In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Darkfost, revealed that a large number of short positions were opened on Binance as Bitcoin dropped from its current all-time high price. According to the crypto pundit, this part of the derivatives market was a source of significant selling pressure on the price of BTC in the following months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced NVT Sits Above This Critical Threshold ‚Äî What It Means For Price Action Darkfost went on to explain that as the price of BTC started its recovery, these short positions, expectedly ‚Äî although slowly, got liquidated, becoming buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. This series of slow liquidations, however, spiked on May 8 to a new single-day high since as far back as March. According to CryptoQuant data, over $31 million in short positions were wiped out on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume. The chart below is of the on-chain indicator showing the amount of liquidations in USD ‚Äî the ‚ÄòShort Liquidations USD‚Äô metric. Furthermore, Darkfost revealed that the relatively low level of funding rates is around 0.004. This trend suggests the abundant presence of short positions in the market, and also the unwillingness of Binance traders to go long.¬† Darkfost concluded that further liquidations or closures of these short positions could cause Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend to regain its momentum, thus facilitating further growth of the premier cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst also mentioned the possibility that this potential regain of bullish strength could push the flagship cryptocurrency to break above its previous all-time-high price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,335, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency has grown by nearly 9% in the past seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Surges Past $2,600: Popular Trader Says ETH Is Leaping Ahead Of Bitcoin. The price performance of Ethereum has been one of the most disappointing features of 2025, with the altcoin closing the first four months of the year at a loss. However, the ETH price appears to be witnessing a strong resurgence, staging a significant return above the $2,600 level this weekend. Interestingly, a popular trader on the social media platform X has come forward with a positive case on the Ethereum price trajectory. According to the crypto pundit, ETH seems set to overtake Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, over the coming months. &#8216;ETH Starting To Feel Like ETH Again&#8217; &#8211; Trader In a recent post on X, pseudonymous crypto trader Axel Bitblaze took a deep dive into why they think the Ethereum price is currently in a strong position and could take the lead ahead of Bitcoin. The online pundit stated several reasons Ethereum could experience significant growth in the next few months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Must Clear This Level Or Risk Crash To $1.9 Firstly, Bitblaze mentioned BlackRock‚Äôs reported purchase of 7,976 ETH (worth about $18.9 million) and push for staking exchange-traded funds. The crypto trader believes that the approval of ETF staking could introduce real, yield-generating institutional demand. Additionally, according to Bitblaze, ETH accumulation by whales is another narrative flying under the radar. On-chain data shows that whales have purchased 138,511 ETH (worth about $337 million) in the past 48 hours. This, combined with $434 million in short liquidations, has brought some momentum to the Ethereum price. Bitblaze noted that more liquidity seems to be flowing into the Ethereum token than Bitcoin, even though it might be exchange-specific, as ETH‚Äôs trading volume surpassed BTC‚Äôs volume for the first time in years.¬† Furthermore, Bitblaze credited the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, as one of the deflationary factors behind ETH‚Äôs future potential. ‚ÄúIn just a few days, ~38,000 ETH has been burned, increasing deflationary pressure,‚Äù the trader added. However, Bitblaze advised investors to exercise caution, as the market sentiment seems to be overheated at the moment. While the latest on-chain data points to a bullish environment, the Fear &#38; Greed Index is at extreme greed, which is often a precursor to minor price pullbacks. Ultimately, Bitblaze believes that stars are beginning to align for the Ethereum token again, and that the sun might shine on the altcoin again. If this happens, the trader believes that the ETH price could travel toward $2,800 or even $3,000 before seeing any major correction. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH sits at around $2,580, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day action underscores the altcoin‚Äôs impressive performance over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is up by more than 40% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Holds Above $1,900 Realized Price Signaling Long-Term Bullish Confidence. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum prices gained by 37.14% in the past week to reach a local peak of $2,600. The majority of this gain has been attributed to the recent Petra network upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to introduce many features, including boosting the ETH burn rate and market scarcity.¬† Amidst Ethereum&#8217;s rally in the past week, the altcoin recorded a significant development that signals a long-term bullish market. Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price &#8211; What Does It Mean? The realized price in the crypto market refers to the average acquisition price of all circulating tokens. It&#8217;s a key indicator of market sentiment as a trading price below the realized price signals a bearish market because investors are holding a loss. The reverse scenario is true for a bullish market.¬† In the analysis provided by CryptoQuant expert Crazzyblockk, ETH is trading above its realized price at $1900 based on the market activity for accumulating addresses, i.e., long-term holders and frequent depositors on the Binance exchange. Notably, this development just occurred in the past week despite the market rebound that has been ongoing since mid-April. The price rise above $1900 proclaims a loud bullish signal as the long-term holders are now in profits, indicating a renewed confidence in ETH‚Äôs long-term value. This confidence is strongly reflected in the fact that most recent ETH outflows are moving from Binance, the most active crypto exchange for ETH trading. When Binance ETH deposit addresses show profitability with the current ETH price above the realized price, it indicates a general increase in traders&#8217; confidence and stronger market activity. Moreover, the price rise above $1900 shows a sustained bullish momentum, indicating the market can absorb profit-taking without breaking the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record Binance Keeps Lead In ETH Liquidity¬† Based on the presented analysis, Crazzyblockk further concludes that Binance boasts the most active ETH trading community in the crypto space. This is indicated by the massive ETH outflows on the exchange, suggesting a high market activity on the exchange during price appreciation.¬† The analyst further tipped the exchange to maintain this dominance as traders will always use the most liquid exchange to manage their positions, either for accumulation or for profit taking. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,525, reflecting a 5.88% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is down by 18.44% and valued at $33.79 billion. ETH next‚Äôs resistance remains at $2,600 following a recent rejection in the past few hours.¬† If the altcoin can successfully move past this barrier, a potential upswing to $2,800 lies ahead. &#160; Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",0.06,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-11T20:16:50.981461,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-holds-above-1900-realized-price-signaling-long-term-bullish-confidence/

News,Solana,"Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move. Solana is gaining momentum once again, with price action pushing above the $175 level for the first time in weeks. The move comes as crypto markets roar back to life, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs push above $100K and Ethereum‚Äôs explosive rally past $2,500. Solana has surged more than 20% in the past week alone, signaling strong demand and a renewed bullish outlook from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Back ‚Äì 880 Million Tokens Accumulated This Month Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical analysis revealing that Solana is now making a strong advance into a key spot‚Äîthe underside of the daily 200 moving average (DMA). The asset is also approaching a lower high around the $180 mark, which previously acted as resistance during the last failed breakout attempt. Cheds notes that reclaiming this zone would be a significant win for bulls, potentially triggering a sharp continuation toward new highs. Market sentiment is turning optimistic across the board, and Solana‚Äôs technical setup reflects that shift. As price approaches the 200DMA, all eyes are on whether SOL can hold this momentum and break through key levels to join the broader market rally. The coming days will be crucial for confirming a full trend reversal. Solana Approaches Pivotal Level As Bulls Eye Breakout Solana is showing renewed strength after a clean breakout above the $160 resistance zone, a level that had capped price action for several weeks. The surge has brought SOL into a critical region that could act as a pivot point‚Äîeither igniting a fresh bullish rally or marking a temporary top before a retrace. As global tensions between the US and China and broader macroeconomic uncertainties linger, the crypto market remains exposed to sudden sentiment shifts. However, recent price action in Solana, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about a continued market recovery. Solana‚Äôs current structure reflects that optimism. The asset is now testing the underside of its daily 200 moving average, a level often viewed by traders as a trend-defining indicator. A successful push above this moving average would add further confidence to the bullish thesis. At the same time, Solana is approaching a lower high near the $180 zone, where the price was previously rejected in March. Cheds points¬†to this convergence as a crucial area: a breakout here could mark the beginning of a larger reversal pattern. Still, risks remain. A rejection at the $180 level could reinforce resistance and trigger a pullback toward the $160 support, especially if macro conditions worsen or profit-taking sets in. For now, however, bulls appear to be in control, and the technical landscape supports a potential continuation‚Äîif momentum holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4H Chart Shows Bullish Consolidation ‚Äì Classic Continuation? Technical Levels: Price Action Shows Strength Solana (SOL) is exhibiting strong momentum as it trades at $176.41, advancing toward a crucial resistance area around the $180 level. The daily chart shows that SOL has surged rapidly from April lows, breaking above both the 200-day EMA ($161.67) and approaching the 200-day SMA ($181.10), a key area that could determine the next major trend. This zone acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past, particularly during Q4 2024 and early 2025. Now, as price returns to this range, it becomes a potential pivot point. If bulls can sustain pressure and close above $181.10 with volume confirmation, it may trigger a continuation toward $200 and possibly retest February highs above $260. However, failure to break above this range could prompt a rejection and consolidation below the 200 SMA.

This is a constructive sign as Solana attempts to reclaim higher ground. For now, the trend remains bullish, but eyes are on the $180‚Äì$185 resistance zone to confirm whether SOL has the strength to continue its breakout or faces a short-term pullback.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach?. After trading in a relatively quiet range for much of April, Dogecoin has started May on a good note. The meme coin has surged over 33% this week, pushing above the $0.22 level due to a new wave of bullish momentum among retail and institutional traders. Amid this recovery, technical indicators are flashing a familiar signal that has led to massive price increases for Dogecoin since 2024. The latest analysis from popular crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade has brought attention to a possible inflection point: a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling MACD Signal Returns, Points To Explosive Upside For Dogecoin Due to its performance since October 2023, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has become a valuable tool for spotting momentum shifts in Dogecoin&#8217;s price cycles. It is now flashing bullish once again. The crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, has coincided with the beginning of powerful uptrends since the current cycle began in Q4 2023.¬† According to Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs chart, the last two confirmed MACD crossovers on the weekly timeframe led to rallies from $0.06 to $0.23 and from $0.086 to $0.48, respectively. Each of these rallies followed a period of deep corrections, conditions similar to what Dogecoin has witnessed since March 2025. The first MACD crossover in this cycle was in October 2023, which resulted in a 285% rally. The second MACD crossover was in September 2024, which led to an even bigger rally of about 460%, during which Dogecoin surged to multi-year highs of $0.48. The chart also reveals that these MACD crossovers occurred after a rounded bottom pattern. The current price structure looks like that setup, with a higher low rounded bottom and the blue MACD line about to cross to the upside of the orange line. This lends strong credence to the notion that Dogecoin could be on the cusp of another rally, particularly as the overall crypto market sentiment is now positive following Bitcoin‚Äôs break above $100,000 again. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade Eyes On $1: Can MACD Rally Repeat One More Time? Now that the MACD crossover is almost underway, the obvious question is whether this can cause Dogecoin to finally reach the elusive $1 mark.¬† The projected $1 target lies on a long-term ascending resistance trendline that guided the $0.23 and $0.48 tops this cycle. If the pattern holds, and Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD crossover plays out as it has in the past, the meme coin might be currently at the start of a third impulsive move. The analyst‚Äôs chart draws a projected trajectory that extends toward $1 by mid-year, following a path similar to the other rallies.¬† Related Reading: Taiwan Official Proposes Bitcoin As Part Of National Reserve Strategy Achieving the $1 target would require a price surge of about 335% from current levels around $0.23. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2335, up by 3.4% in the past 24 hours and an intraday high of $0.2569.
