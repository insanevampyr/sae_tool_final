I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:26:48.225644+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:45:53.710510+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:52:02.260841+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:12:48.365447+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:40:14.850692+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000?. Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal juncture after days of consistent selling pressure that have pushed the price down by more than 12% since last Tuesday. Currently hovering around the $2,400 mark, ETH is struggling to maintain bullish momentum, and many analysts warn that a deeper correction could follow if bulls fail to defend this crucial support zone. The recent drop reflects broader market uncertainty, with rising volatility shaking investor confidence just as ETH appeared ready to join a wider altcoin breakout. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours Despite this weakness, there’s growing optimism in some corners of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis showing that a Golden Cross has been confirmed on Ethereum’s 12-hour chart — a signal traditionally viewed as a precursor to major bullish moves. This crossover, which occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average, often marks the beginning of an extended uptrend. If bulls manage to hold current levels and reclaim higher resistance near $2,600, the Golden Cross could become a turning point. Until then, the coming days will be critical in determining whether Ethereum can bounce or sink into a longer consolidation phase. Volatility Hits Ethereum Amid Golden Cross Signal Ethereum saw sharp volatility over the weekend, surging past $2,550 before rapidly reversing and falling back into the $2,400 zone within hours. This sudden move has sparked renewed uncertainty, as analysts grow cautious about the fading bullish momentum and rising selling pressure. While ETH remains one of the stronger performers in the broader altcoin market, it is still down 36% from its December high of around $4,100. This leaves bulls with a clear challenge: hold current levels and regain control by pushing prices above $2,800 to ignite a sustained rally. The $2,400 level is now acting as a critical support zone. A break below it could trigger a deeper retracement, likely dragging Ethereum into a consolidation range or even toward lower support levels. Still, technical signals offer a glimmer of hope. According to Pillows, Ethereum recently confirmed a Golden Cross on the 12-hour chart — a bullish pattern that occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average. Historically, such signals have preceded strong upside moves, and Pillow believes this one could pave the way for Ethereum to reach $3,000 in the near term. However, for that to happen, buyers must step in decisively. Volume has tapered off, and sentiment appears fragile after last week&#8217;s breakdown. If bulls can defend the $2,400 region and reclaim higher resistance quickly, the Golden Cross might mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next leg up. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode, watching whether the bullish signal can outweigh the growing pressure from sellers. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound ETH Tests Key Support After Drop From Local Highs Ethereum is trading at $2,402 after a sharp Sunday sell-off, where the price spiked to $2,670 before retracing more than 10% in less than 24 hours. As seen in the 4-hour chart, ETH is now consolidating right above the $2,390–$2,400 zone, a level that is proving critical for bulls to hold. This area coincides with a prior consolidation zone and could act as a short-term support base. The 200-period EMA on the 4H chart is currently at $2,130, and the 200 SMA is near $1,991 — both are significantly below the current price and offer long-term trend support. However, the volume profile shows a spike in sell-side activity during the pullback, suggesting that short-term traders are locking in profits. If price breaks below $2,390, a deeper retrace toward the $2,200–$2,300 range becomes likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform On the upside, ETH must reclaim $2,550 to reestablish momentum. Failure to do so could confirm a local top. The price action is clearly indecisive, and this range-bound structure could persist unless bulls reassert strength with a decisive move above $2,600. Until then, the $2,400 level remains a battleground between buyers and sellers amid elevated volatility. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0659463118580765,

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent?. The Dogecoin price could be at a critical juncture for a breakout but momentum needs to persist. On the four-hour chart shared by analyst Josh Olszewicz, price has been sliding inside a clearly defined falling-wedge formation since printing a local high at $0.25941 on 13 May. The upper and lower boundaries of that wedge continue to drift lower, trapping successive swing highs and lows; the lower rail is presently guiding support at while the upper rail caps the market near $0.219. Within that compression, Olszewicz overlays an Ichimoku system set to short-cycle parameters (20/60/120/30). The most recent completed candle — stamped 17 May 08:00 UTC — settled at $0.21532 after trading between $0.21187 and $0.21676. That close left price lodged squarely inside the cloud, a location that typically denotes equilibrium. Internally, the Tenkan-sen rests at $0.21427, the Kijun-sen at $0.22524, Senkou Span A at $0.22102 and Senkou Span B at $0.21184, creating an unusually tight band of short-term reference levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tops Tend To Follow Surges In Retail Futures Activity, Analysis Shows The zone between the wedge floor and Span B around $0.212–0.214 forms a high-confluence support zone that has already produced two intraday rebounds. Conversely, the Kijun-sen and descending wedge resistance intersect near $0.225, erecting an equally visible ceiling overhead. As long as price remains trapped between those two lines, momentum traders are likely to see a low-volatility coil; the first decisive breach — particularly a four-hour close through the upper rail — would satisfy every textbook criterion for a bullish falling-wedge resolution and mechanically projects a return toward the 13 May high. Dogecoin Looks Still Strong Cantonese Cat’s weekly perspective speaks to a larger cycle. In his chart, Dogecoin has just finished its first weekly close above the Bull Market Support Band — essentially the 20-week simple moving average enveloped by a two-sigma envelope — since early February. That band currently spans $0.21617 at the lower edge to $0.22378 at the upper edge; last week’s candle settled at $0.22387, a whisker above the cap, converting what had been resistance throughout the spring into provisional support. The break occurs while the Bollinger upper band is still descending from the February crest near $0.35, an indication that volatility on the weekly time-frame has only just begun to contract after a multi-month bear unwind. The midline of the Bollinger structure, identical to the 20-week SMA and the top of the Bull Market Support Band, is therefore the single most important pivot for the week ahead. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target A second consecutive weekly settlement above $0.22378 would confirm the first as more than a one-off spike and could embolden trend-followers to price in a medium-term push toward the mid-$0.30s where the upper band presently curves. Taken together, the two time-frames sketch a clear roadmap. Short-term traders will be looking for a resolution of the descending wedge; a bullish breakout through $0.219 would immediately shift focus to prior supply at $0.24-0.26, whereas a failure to hold $0.205 risks an acceleration toward the April pivot at $0.185. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.217. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0654393939393939,

2025-05-20T16:21:40.043339+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $165 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Recovers Above $165 Solana price formed a base above the $160 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL gained pace for a move above the $162 and $165 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $172 resistance zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low is acting as a resistance. Solana is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $172 level. The next major resistance is near the $176 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $168 zone. The first major support is near the $165 level. A break below the $165 level might send the price toward the $162 zone. If there is a close below the $162 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

2025-05-20T16:27:28.779187+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T16:52:55.732505+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T17:18:47.910595+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

2025-05-20T17:37:05.570475+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T18:59:34.361164+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T18:59:34.361164+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T19:03:04.701220+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T19:03:04.701220+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T19:12:26.764424+00:00,Ethereum,Reddit,"Ethereum (ETH) Throughput Is Going Parabolic - 78.82M Gas/sec Proves Scaling Is No Longer Just a Theory

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T19:12:26.764424+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

All of us have a price in mind that would carve us out of the crypto markets and into lavish living (though there are no doubt some who think bitcoin will matter in a post-electric world and that electronic currency will somehow outlast physical currency and the concept of trade). With World War 3 approaching swiftly with America's swan dive into fascism, what is your exit number? From an actual value-behind-the-currency, we've already seen the USD get downgraded as the world finally realizes that ""vibes""are not a long-store of value.

2025-05-20T20:45:01.205675+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T20:45:01.205675+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices.

2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T21:45:01.761114+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T21:45:01.761114+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T22:45:01.975871+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist.

ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-21T00:45:10.100895+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-21T00:45:10.100895+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious.

2025-05-21T02:45:02.605584+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum’s Revenge: Arthur Hayes Predicts Run To $10,000. In a macro-focused interview with the Bankless podcast, Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO and current Maelstrom CIO, laid out his bullish thesis on Ethereum, arguing that a move to $10,000 or even $15,000 is a realistic outcome as global liquidity shifts and capital controls take hold in the next monetary regime. Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,” he said. “It’s just human nature.” For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running&#8230; it was time.” Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. “It’s great it’s going up, but okay—let’s talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let’s talk when it’s meaningful.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum’s rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary “phase shift”—a transition away from the US Treasury as the world’s reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. “They print the money,” he said bluntly. “And the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.” Still, Ethereum’s path won’t be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH’s underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH’s moment is coming—particularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 – Here’s Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. “If you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,” he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is “a hard slog” now—yet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. “Mailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it&#8217;s physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That&#8217;s it,” Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there’s even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE 🔥#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout💹 The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next… pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it’s still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn’t spiked yet, so the setup isn’t sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There&#8217;s no way I couldn&#8217;t take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv — Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a “twofold rally” from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That’s about 114% higher. He’s confident there’s “no way you won’t take a Dogecoin trade” if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‑and‑shoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that’s capped gains since December’s $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42–$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100–104% jump from today’s price. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1057779275232105,

2025-05-21T05:45:01.770454+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 – Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming?. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the $2,500 mark, signs of market exhaustion are beginning to emerge. Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH’s total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble&#8217;s size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups &#8211; Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum’s ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset&#8217;s market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum&#8217;s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum’s impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset’s future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH’s 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ​​In another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle’s upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum’s daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant, X, and TradingView.com",0.0935912698412698,

2025-05-21T05:45:01.770454+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest. Dogecoin has entered a critical phase as it consolidates below the $0.26 resistance level, facing rising pressure after a sharp rejection last week. Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T06:45:01.817702+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest. Dogecoin has entered a critical phase as it consolidates below the $0.26 resistance level, facing rising pressure after a sharp rejection last week. Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T09:45:01.232088+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T10:45:01.737885+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm.

Hi everyone! I’m Negmat from Tajikistan. My real name and photos are open in Telegram—you can ask me anything. English isn’t my first language, but I do my best and write with a translator so people anywhere in the world can understand.

In the previous articles, I explained that CITU isn’t just a coin. It’s an experiment: can we put the ideas of Mises, Hayek, Friedman, and the Austrian school into practice—so anyone can see how economic theory works in reality?

**Why We Left Classic Bitcoin Behind**

When we first launched CITU, we used the classic Bitcoin difficulty algorithm. It was honest: if a big miner showed up, difficulty shot up; if they left, the network would get “stuck,” miners would leave, and monopoly only got worse. Volatility was huge. That’s why we switched to a hybrid model, where the market itself determines the difficulty—if you’re ready to take more risk, you get more, and if you want stability, you can still participate.

**How Staking Really Works in CITU—and Why It’s Not a “Deposit”**

In CITU, staking isn’t about earning interest on your deposit. Coins give you “points” that boost your chances of winning a block, but it’s not simple: the first point costs 1.1 coins, the second 2.1, the third 4.1, the fourth 8.1, and so on (maximum is 30 points). If you have 6.1 coins, that’s 3 points; if you have 10 coins, it’s still only 3 points—the rest are just sitting there, so it’s better to either sell them or buy up to the next point threshold.

This creates a dynamic: when the price rises, people sell off extra coins; if it falls, they buy the missing coins to reach the next point. This really smooths out volatility, helps stabilize price, and at the same time, protects the network.

**Transaction Points—A Real Incentive for Miners**

The second key thing: miners also get points for transactions. Every time a block includes, say, 1,000 coins of transfers, that brings the miner extra points: the first point is for 0.11 coins, the second for 0.21, the third for 0.41, etc. But transaction points can never exceed staking points—this is on purpose, to encourage staking and keep the network active. So a miner isn’t just motivated to hold coins, but to collect and include as many transactions as possible. The network is working, and you can see it directly in the blocks.

**How Randomness Defends Against Monopoly**

One more feature—randomness for every block. It’s calculated from the block’s hash (from 0 to 170), with the hash as the seed, so for any given block, you’ll always get the same “random” value. This protects the network from centralization: even if you have huge computing power, there’s always a chance someone else can win the block. That really makes the game fair for everyone.

**Why CITU Is Truly Rare and Stable**

— There will only ever be 226 million coins, each divisible down to 0.01—so the real “pennies” over all time are even fewer than with Bitcoin.  
— Inflation goes down every year; in 10 years, it’ll be just 0.17–0.25%. No “inflationary” coin can promise that.  
— History shows: after moving to this algorithm, the price became much more stable, and it’s all thanks to mechanisms that the Austrian school theorized about years ago.

**Why I’m Telling You All This**

I’m not here to “sell” a coin. I want you to see: if you don’t interfere, economic ideas work in practice. If you have questions, ask away—I’m always open to dialogue, and my real identity is open.

2025-05-21T12:45:02.158249+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

**Part 3. Why Staking and Transaction Points in CITU Aren’t About “Interest”—They’re About Stability and a Fair Game**

Hi everyone! I’m Negmat from Tajikistan. My real name and photos are open in Telegram—you can ask me anything. English isn’t my first language, but I do my best and write with a translator so people anywhere in the world can understand.

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,580 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,480 and $2,500 levels. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,585 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price started a downside correction below the $2,500 level, unlike Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,480 and $2,460 support levels. However, the bulls were active near the $2,450 zone. A low was formed at $2,445 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $2,480 and $2,500 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,588 swing high to the $2,445 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,555 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,588 swing high to the $2,445 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,585 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,620 level. A clear move above the $2,620 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T14:45:01.471688+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"Part 3. Why Staking and Transaction Points in CITU Aren’t About “Interest”—They’re About Stability and a Fair Game

**Part 3. Why Staking and Transaction Points in CITU Aren’t About “Interest”—They’re About Stability and a Fair Game**

Hi everyone! I’m Negmat from Tajikistan. My real name and photos are open in Telegram—you can ask me anything. English isn’t my first language, but I do my best and write with a translator so people anywhere in the world can understand.

In the previous articles, I explained that CITU isn’t just a coin. It’s an experiment: can we put the ideas of Mises, Hayek, Friedman, and the Austrian school into practice—so anyone can see how economic theory works in reality?

**Why We Left Classic Bitcoin Behind**

When we first launched CITU, we used the classic Bitcoin difficulty algorithm. It was honest: if a big miner showed up, difficulty shot up; if they left, the network would get “stuck,” miners would leave, and monopoly only got worse. Volatility was huge. That’s why we switched to a hybrid model, where the market itself determines the difficulty—if you’re ready to take more risk, you get more, and if you want stability, you can still participate.

**How Staking Really Works in CITU—and Why It’s Not a “Deposit”**

In CITU, staking isn’t about earning interest on your deposit. Coins give you “points” that boost your chances of winning a block, but it’s not simple: the first point costs 1.1 coins, the second 2.1, the third 4.1, the fourth 8.1, and so on (maximum is 30 points). If you have 6.1 coins, that’s 3 points; if you have 10 coins, it’s still only 3 points—the rest are just sitting there, so it’s better to either sell them or buy up to the next point threshold.

This creates a dynamic: when the price rises, people sell off extra coins; if it falls, they buy the missing coins to reach the next point. This really smooths out volatility, helps stabilize price, and at the same time, protects the network.

**Transaction Points—A Real Incentive for Miners**

The second key thing: miners also get points for transactions. Every time a block includes, say, 1,000 coins of transfers, that brings the miner extra points: the first point is for 0.11 coins, the second for 0.21, the third for 0.41, etc. But transaction points can never exceed staking points—this is on purpose, to encourage staking and keep the network active. So a miner isn’t just motivated to hold coins, but to collect and include as many transactions as possible. The network is working, and you can see it directly in the blocks.

**How Randomness Defends Against Monopoly**

One more feature—randomness for every block. It’s calculated from the block’s hash (from 0 to 170), with the hash as the seed, so for any given block, you’ll always get the same “random” value. This protects the network from centralization: even if you have huge computing power, there’s always a chance someone else can win the block. That really makes the game fair for everyone.

**Why CITU Is Truly Rare and Stable**

— There will only ever be 226 million coins, each divisible down to 0.01—so the real “pennies” over all time are even fewer than with Bitcoin.  
— Inflation goes down every year; in 10 years, it’ll be just 0.17–0.25%. No “inflationary” coin can promise that.  
— History shows: after moving to this algorithm, the price became much more stable, and it’s all thanks to mechanisms that the Austrian school theorized about years ago.

**Why I’m Telling You All This**

I’m not here to “sell” a coin. I want you to see: if you don’t interfere, economic ideas work in practice. If you have questions, ask away—I’m always open to dialogue, and my real identity is open.

This whole process is fucking convoluted and searching for answers leads me in circles.

I have pull up the Reddit Vault in Metamask (While having Arbitrum Nova selected)... I can see my moons.  If I choose Arbitrum One, then I can't see the Moons.  Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,

Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

This whole process is fucking convoluted and searching for answers leads me in circles.

I have pull up the Reddit Vault in Metamask (While having Arbitrum Nova selected)... I can see my moons.  If I choose Arbitrum One, then I can't see the Moons.  Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,
2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 – Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming?. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the $2,500 mark, signs of market exhaustion are beginning to emerge. Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH’s total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble&#8217;s size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups &#8211; Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum’s ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset&#8217;s market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum&#8217;s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum’s impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset’s future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH’s 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ​​In another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle’s upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum’s daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant, X, and TradingView.com",0.0935912698412698,
2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,
2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Volume has decreased slightly since the early May breakout, hinting at possible exhaustion or consolidation before another leg.

2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,

On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn.

2025-05-21T17:45:01.825195+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T17:45:01.825195+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Volume has decreased slightly since the early May breakout, hinting at possible exhaustion or consolidation before another leg.

2025-05-21T17:45:01.825195+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

2025-05-21T19:03:05.060745+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage.

2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,
2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Volume has decreased slightly since the early May breakout, hinting at possible exhaustion or consolidation before another leg.

2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T20:45:01.393562+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

Hi,

A couple years ago I bought this token called MarketMove (https://app.marketmove.ai/)  which later on around early 2024 if im not mistaken) migrated to Fastlane (https://fastlane.foundation/). Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

FastLane's token is on Solana



We finally then did the migration, but the tokens never showed up on my wallet, on Solana's network(?)",0.06875,

Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

2025-05-21T22:45:02.074296+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T22:45:02.074296+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly.

According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T23:45:01.435440+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Hi,

A couple years ago I bought this token called MarketMove (https://app.marketmove.ai/)  which later on around early 2024 if im not mistaken) migrated to Fastlane (https://fastlane.foundation/). Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

FastLane's token is on Solana



We finally then did the migration, but the tokens never showed up on my wallet, on Solana's network(?)",0.06875,

Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

2025-05-22T01:45:01.559032+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-22T01:45:01.559032+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

2025-05-22T02:45:01.940424+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana’s BONK Targets 77% Corrective Move After Retrace To 200 EMA. BONK&#8217;s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level.  This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin, Analyst Says Solana Meme Coin “BONK” Is About To Explode Interestingly, this movement has led to a consolidation between these levels since May 15, and according to the TradingView analyst, the price structure suggests buyers are stepping in to defend the trend. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a higher low.  From a volume standpoint, each upward impulse has shown rising volume since the first week of April. However, the recent decline occurred on diminishing volume, hinting at exhaustion from sellers.  77% Upside Move If BONK Breaks Above Resistance Even with the current range, BONK is still within a bullish setup that could send it towards a new 2025 high and possibly towards its current all-time high levels. The important level to watch now is the point of control (POC) resistance at approximately $0.00001955. This level previously acted as the pivot point before the pullback and now serves as the threshold for bullish continuation.  Related Reading: This Dogecoin Rival Is Set For An Over 100% Pump – It’s Not Shiba Inu A confirmed close above this region would likely trigger a rapid expansion move toward the next resistance cluster around $0.00002581, before eventually reaching the predicted price target of $0.00003243, which would bring it close to its January 2025 open of $0.000035. As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor. If buyers manage to maintain pressure and secure a decisive breakout, the stage could be set for a strong rally into the upper resistance band and a retest of BONK’s 2025 swing high.

2025-05-22T03:45:01.389687+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Token migration help

Hi,

A couple years ago I bought this token called MarketMove (https://app.marketmove.ai/)  which later on around early 2024 if im not mistaken) migrated to Fastlane (https://fastlane.foundation/). Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

FastLane's token is on Solana



We finally then did the migration, but the tokens never showed up on my wallet, on Solana's network(?)",0.06875,
2025-05-22T03:45:01.389687+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana’s BONK Targets 77% Corrective Move After Retrace To 200 EMA. BONK&#8217;s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level.  This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin, Analyst Says Solana Meme Coin “BONK” Is About To Explode Interestingly, this movement has led to a consolidation between these levels since May 15, and according to the TradingView analyst, the price structure suggests buyers are stepping in to defend the trend. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a higher low.  From a volume standpoint, each upward impulse has shown rising volume since the first week of April. However, the recent decline occurred on diminishing volume, hinting at exhaustion from sellers.  77% Upside Move If BONK Breaks Above Resistance Even with the current range, BONK is still within a bullish setup that could send it towards a new 2025 high and possibly towards its current all-time high levels. The important level to watch now is the point of control (POC) resistance at approximately $0.00001955. This level previously acted as the pivot point before the pullback and now serves as the threshold for bullish continuation.  Related Reading: This Dogecoin Rival Is Set For An Over 100% Pump – It’s Not Shiba Inu A confirmed close above this region would likely trigger a rapid expansion move toward the next resistance cluster around $0.00002581, before eventually reaching the predicted price target of $0.00003243, which would bring it close to its January 2025 open of $0.000035. As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor. If buyers manage to maintain pressure and secure a decisive breakout, the stage could be set for a strong rally into the upper resistance band and a retest of BONK’s 2025 swing high.

Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034.

As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor.

Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.

BONK&#8217;s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level.  This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections.

2025-05-22T13:45:01.998779+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"The Ultimate Irony: The Fiat System May Soon Be “Backed” by Crypto

We’re about to witness something beautifully ironic.

With stablecoin legislation gaining momentum, the U.S. dollar may soon be propped up—not by gold, not by productivity, not by sound monetary policy—but by stablecoins. That’s right: the very crypto instruments they once dismissed as dangerous could soon be the duct tape holding together a rapidly decaying fiat system.

Think about it. The dollar has been steadily bleeding purchasing power for decades, a direct result of Keynesian economic dogma and the fiat system’s built-in design flaw: eventual failure. But instead of fixing the fundamentals, the system is now pivoting to crypto… to back itself.

Tether, USDC, and others are becoming lifeboats lashed to the Titanic.

And while they might buy time, they won’t buy salvation. Stablecoins are still tethered (pun intended) to the same failing fiat they’re meant to reflect. They are not the endgame.

Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is the ultimate black hole of value—silent, patient, inevitable. People don’t just use it; they hodl it. And as more fiat is digitized and funneled through stablecoins, more value inevitably seeps toward the hardest asset ever discovered: BTC

So in an epic twist, the fiat system may extend its life by clinging to crypto rails… only to be slowly devoured by the very force it once tried to suppress.

The transfer of wealth has already begun. They just don’t realize they’re the liquidity exit.

2025-05-22T14:45:02.055460+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"The Ultimate Irony: The Fiat System May Soon Be “Backed” by Crypto

We’re about to witness something beautifully ironic.

With stablecoin legislation gaining momentum, the U.S. dollar may soon be propped up—not by gold, not by productivity, not by sound monetary policy—but by stablecoins. That’s right: the very crypto instruments they once dismissed as dangerous could soon be the duct tape holding together a rapidly decaying fiat system.

Think about it. The dollar has been steadily bleeding purchasing power for decades, a direct result of Keynesian economic dogma and the fiat system’s built-in design flaw: eventual failure. But instead of fixing the fundamentals, the system is now pivoting to crypto… to back itself.

Tether, USDC, and others are becoming lifeboats lashed to the Titanic.

And while they might buy time, they won’t buy salvation. Stablecoins are still tethered (pun intended) to the same failing fiat they’re meant to reflect. They are not the endgame.

Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is the ultimate black hole of value—silent, patient, inevitable. People don’t just use it; they hodl it. And as more fiat is digitized and funneled through stablecoins, more value inevitably seeps toward the hardest asset ever discovered: BTC

So in an epic twist, the fiat system may extend its life by clinging to crypto rails… only to be slowly devoured by the very force it once tried to suppress.

The transfer of wealth has already begun. They just don’t realize they’re the liquidity exit.

2025-05-22T15:45:02.186552+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.

Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure.

2025-05-22T17:45:07.672158+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.

2025-05-22T18:45:01.852314+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.

2025-05-22T19:03:04.636766+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure.

2025-05-22T19:45:01.230509+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure.

2025-05-22T19:45:01.230509+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.241. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0822471066348617,

2025-05-22T21:45:01.881748+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, the price is still within a consolidation range, and bulls must hold above $2,600 to maintain this breakout potential.

2025-05-22T21:45:01.881748+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.
