At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.</em></p><h2>Ways to earn yield on Bitcoin</h2><p>While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"">bridging</a> BTC to other blockchains.</p><h3>Centralized lending platforms</h3><p>Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"">collapse of firms</a> like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability.&nbsp;</p><h3>WBTC on Ethereum</h3><p>WBTC is an <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"">ERC-20 token</a> backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo).

This unlocks DeFi&rsquo;s potential but introduces risks from BitGo&rsquo;s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.</p><h3>Bitcoin layer-2 platforms</h3><p>Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin&rsquo;s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after &ldquo;the Merge,&rdquo; replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain&rsquo;s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.</em></p><h2>How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform</h2><p>Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.</p><p>Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.</p></li></ul><p>Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.</p><figure><img alt=""Stake BTC on Binance Earn"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36c-448c-7d76-b618-b502aba3d789"" title="""" /></figure><p>After subscribing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term&rsquo;s end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.</p></li></ul><p>Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.</p><h2>How to earn yield with WBTC on Ethereum</h2><p>WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum&rsquo;s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"">liquidity pools</a> and earning interest or fees.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Convert BTC to WBTC:</strong> Use a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"">centralized exchange (CEX)</a> (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transfer WBTC to a wallet:</strong> Move WBTC to a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"">Web3</a> wallet like <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"">MetaMask</a> and make sure you have enough Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"">gas fees</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect to a DeFi protocol:</strong> Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform&rsquo;s interface.</p></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Connect your wallet to Aave platform"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36d-bb40-714c-bdc9-e4ff139bd2fc"" title="""" /></figure><ul><li><p><strong>Earn yield:</strong> By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.</p></li></ul><h2>How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2s</h2><p>Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon&rsquo;s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with Babylon:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up a compatible wallet:</strong> Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses.

Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em> <em>In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.</em></p><h2>Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocols</h2><p>Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security.</p><h3>Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol</h3><p>Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.</p><h3>Stacking in the Stacks Protocol</h3><p>Stacking is Stacks&rsquo; yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"">STX</a>) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.</p><h2>Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained</h2><p>Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"">deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns</a> for institutional investors outside the US.&nbsp;</p><p>The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"">spot and futures markets</a>, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting annual net returns of 4&ndash;8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin &mdash; an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Risks involved in earning yield with BTC</h2><p>Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Custodial risk:</strong> Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC&rsquo;s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network maturity:</strong> Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market risk:</strong> Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>How earning yield with BTC may evolve</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin&rsquo;s censorship resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you?

By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded.

The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,&rdquo; commented Ben Adams.</p><p>A sentiment that was <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617/7"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoed</a> by another anonymous commenter, &ldquo;I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.&rdquo;</p><p>Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‚ÄòLooks Incredible Here,‚Äô Says Crypto Analyst ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 spike‚Äîfueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù appearance‚Äîas a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is ‚Äúnowhere near crossing,‚Äù implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‚ÄòLooks Incredible Here,‚Äô Says Crypto Analyst ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 spike‚Äîfueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù appearance‚Äîas a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is ‚Äúnowhere near crossing,‚Äù implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources.

While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-layers-of-blockchain-technology"">layer-1 blockchain</a> works.</p><p>Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn&rsquo;t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you?

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations.

Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April.

Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,&rdquo; commented Ben Adams.</p><p>A sentiment that was <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617/7"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoed</a> by another anonymous commenter, &ldquo;I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.&rdquo;</p><p>Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery.

Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

A short-term pullback wouldn‚Äôt invalidate the trend, but failure to hold above $2,500 could stall momentum.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‚ÄòLooks Incredible Here,‚Äô Says Crypto Analyst ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 spike‚Äîfueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù appearance‚Äîas a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is ‚Äúnowhere near crossing,‚Äù implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.</p><h2>Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over gold</h2><p>While traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Bitcoin Outpaces Stocks According to reports, the S&#38;P 500 declined almost 1% during April, but Bitcoin rose. Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April.

Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable.

Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86.

The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer&rsquo;s simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.</p><p>The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,&rdquo; <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617"">said Buterin</a>.</p><p>Ethereum continues to face high <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/transaction-fees-explained"">transaction fees</a> and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,&rdquo; commented Ben Adams.</p><p>A sentiment that was <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617/7"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoed</a> by another anonymous commenter, &ldquo;I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.&rdquo;</p><p>Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-5-772078-20250422"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">added</a> Adam Cochran.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-layers-of-blockchain-technology"">layer-1 blockchain</a> works.</p><p>Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn&rsquo;t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin&rsquo;s proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.</p>                    </div></div>

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

News,Solana,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-layers-of-blockchain-technology"">layer-1 blockchain</a> works.</p><p>Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn&rsquo;t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Bitcoin Outpaces Stocks According to reports, the S&#38;P 500 declined almost 1% during April, but Bitcoin rose. Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April. It held up incredibly strong during a sharp sell off on stocks in April. It then also proceeded to outperform as the markets bounced and tariffs were implemented.

Regulators would catch any large cross-border payments made in crypto. There has not been a reported case of governments turning to Bitcoin in order to sidestep duties. Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone. Some pattern observers claim an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders configuration could develop. üí∞ $BTC Market Update#Bitcoin is currently testing the Weekly Supply Zone around $105,000 üëÄ üß† The most likely scenario is a rejection from this level, leading to the formation of an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders pattern ‚Äî a setup that could create space for a mini #altseason üìà‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/aLSPi5qhuq ‚Äî Rose Premium Signals üåπ (@VipRoseTr) May 11, 2025 That pattern requires two distinct shoulders and a lower trough in the middle. Currently, the swings have been unbalanced, muddying the image. A rejection might be followed by a brief period of altcoin accumulation before Bitcoin takes off again where it left off. Related Reading: New XRP Rally Incoming? Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert.

After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T22:45:11.392486+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T23:45:11.285874+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other.

News,Solana,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T00:45:13.232376+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T01:43:09.861849+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.</p><h2>Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over gold</h2><p>While traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative. For example, gold fell 3.4% on May 12 as the demand for safe-haven assets declined.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price sells off after Trump&rsquo;s US-China tariff deal &mdash; Here is why"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c603-c888-76f6-aec9-e6c01bf84e4a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Gold/USD (left) vs. DXY US Dollar Index (right).

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year.

Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T01:45:10.603295+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40√ó margin. At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain.

Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T02:23:17.149071+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.</p><h2>Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over gold</h2><p>While traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative. For example, gold fell 3.4% on May 12 as the demand for safe-haven assets declined.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price sells off after Trump&rsquo;s US-China tariff deal &mdash; Here is why"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c603-c888-76f6-aec9-e6c01bf84e4a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Gold/USD (left) vs. DXY US Dollar Index (right).

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40√ó margin. At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain.

Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T02:45:10.325350+00:00,

Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery.

Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

A short-term pullback wouldn‚Äôt invalidate the trend, but failure to hold above $2,500 could stall momentum.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40√ó margin. At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain.

Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer&rsquo;s simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.</p><p>The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,&rdquo; <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617"">said Buterin</a>.</p><p>Ethereum continues to face high <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/transaction-fees-explained"">transaction fees</a> and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC‚Äôs trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). At press time, ETH trades at $2,555, up 3% in the past 24 hours.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T03:45:12.230618+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong.

At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain.

Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC‚Äôs trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). At press time, ETH trades at $2,555, up 3% in the past 24 hours.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T04:45:11.019147+00:00,

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain.

Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC‚Äôs trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF).

The first major support sits near the $2,350 zone and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,272 swing low to the $2,624 high. A clear move below the $2,350 support might push the price toward the $2,275 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,200. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T05:45:12.687279+00:00,

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse.

At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain.

Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent?

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40√ó margin. At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain. Many gamblers are shorting $BTC with high leverage! 0x51d9 opened a $93M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $105,690. 0x5D2F opened a $44M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $112,660.https://t.co/WcW1u4FdWz‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/pAf1LEMnZp ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 Second Whale Holding At Crossroads Another account took a $44 million short at $103,494.40, again using 40√ó cross margin. Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors.

VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent?

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40√ó margin. At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain. Many gamblers are shorting $BTC with high leverage! 0x51d9 opened a $93M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $105,690. 0x5D2F opened a $44M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $112,660.https://t.co/WcW1u4FdWz‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/pAf1LEMnZp ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 Second Whale Holding At Crossroads Another account took a $44 million short at $103,494.40, again using 40√ó cross margin. Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details This frenzy shows that betting big against Bitcoin‚Äôs rally can end badly and fast.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors. Related Reading: XRP Chart Hits Critical Level That ‚ÄòOpens The Sky,‚Äô Analyst Warns Looking ahead, Ethereum&#8217;s future performance is closely tied to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed) monetary policy decisions. With quantitative tightening (QT) slowing to $5 billion per month‚Äîthe lowest rate in recent history‚Äîthe analyst is keenly anticipating a potential pause in QT by the third or fourth quarter of this year.¬† VirtualBacon forecasts that this pause could trigger a bottoming out of the ETH/BTC pair, paving the way for significant upside movement for the Ethereum price. VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000. When writing, ETH trades at $2,440, up by 8% in the past seven days.¬† Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",0.15,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T08:45:14.461977+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC‚Äôs trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF).

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market.

Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors. Related Reading: XRP Chart Hits Critical Level That ‚ÄòOpens The Sky,‚Äô Analyst Warns Looking ahead, Ethereum&#8217;s future performance is closely tied to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed) monetary policy decisions. With quantitative tightening (QT) slowing to $5 billion per month‚Äîthe lowest rate in recent history‚Äîthe analyst is keenly anticipating a potential pause in QT by the third or fourth quarter of this year.¬† VirtualBacon forecasts that this pause could trigger a bottoming out of the ETH/BTC pair, paving the way for significant upside movement for the Ethereum price. VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000. When writing, ETH trades at $2,440, up by 8% in the past seven days.¬† Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",0.15,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T09:45:11.447476+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC‚Äôs trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). At press time, ETH trades at $2,555, up 3% in the past 24 hours.

ETH is now correcting gains and might revisit the $2,350 support zone. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $2,600 resistance. The price is trading above $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins.

VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC‚Äôs trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). At press time, ETH trades at $2,555, up 3% in the past 24 hours.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Dips: Healthy Cooldown or Warning Sign of Bigger Trouble?. Ethereum price extended its increase above the $2,500 zone. ETH is now correcting gains and might revisit the $2,350 support zone. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $2,600 resistance. The price is trading above $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could find bids near $2,350 and start a fresh increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Fresh Increase Ethereum price remained supported and started a fresh increase above $2,350, beating Bitcoin. ETH gained pace for a move above the $2,400 resistance zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the $2,550 resistance zone. The price gained over 35% and recently tested the $2,600 resistance zone. A high was formed at $2,624 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a minor decline below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,272 swing low to the $2,624 high. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bulls are still active above $2,400. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,500 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,620 level. A clear move above the $2,620 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,780 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start a fresh downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,400 level. The first major support sits near the $2,350 zone and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,272 swing low to the $2,624 high. A clear move below the $2,350 support might push the price toward the $2,275 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,200. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least.

With the return of investors into the risk market, the Bitcoin price could quickly cross $110,000 as early as Wednesday.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors.

VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent?

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors.

VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent?

Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF).

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors.

VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market.

Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors. Related Reading: XRP Chart Hits Critical Level That ‚ÄòOpens The Sky,‚Äô Analyst Warns Looking ahead, Ethereum&#8217;s future performance is closely tied to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed) monetary policy decisions. With quantitative tightening (QT) slowing to $5 billion per month‚Äîthe lowest rate in recent history‚Äîthe analyst is keenly anticipating a potential pause in QT by the third or fourth quarter of this year.¬† VirtualBacon forecasts that this pause could trigger a bottoming out of the ETH/BTC pair, paving the way for significant upside movement for the Ethereum price. VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000. When writing, ETH trades at $2,440, up by 8% in the past seven days.¬† Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",0.15,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T14:45:11.694229+00:00,

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you&rsquo;ll wish you had one.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.</strong></em></p></p>

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors. Related Reading: XRP Chart Hits Critical Level That ‚ÄòOpens The Sky,‚Äô Analyst Warns Looking ahead, Ethereum&#8217;s future performance is closely tied to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed) monetary policy decisions. With quantitative tightening (QT) slowing to $5 billion per month‚Äîthe lowest rate in recent history‚Äîthe analyst is keenly anticipating a potential pause in QT by the third or fourth quarter of this year.¬† VirtualBacon forecasts that this pause could trigger a bottoming out of the ETH/BTC pair, paving the way for significant upside movement for the Ethereum price. VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000. When writing, ETH trades at $2,440, up by 8% in the past seven days.¬† Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",0.15,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T15:45:13.564438+00:00,

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you&rsquo;ll wish you had one.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.</strong></em></p></p>

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least. This gives time and most importantly, confidence in risk assets such as Bitcoin for investors looking for gains.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors. Related Reading: XRP Chart Hits Critical Level That ‚ÄòOpens The Sky,‚Äô Analyst Warns Looking ahead, Ethereum&#8217;s future performance is closely tied to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed) monetary policy decisions. With quantitative tightening (QT) slowing to $5 billion per month‚Äîthe lowest rate in recent history‚Äîthe analyst is keenly anticipating a potential pause in QT by the third or fourth quarter of this year.¬† VirtualBacon forecasts that this pause could trigger a bottoming out of the ETH/BTC pair, paving the way for significant upside movement for the Ethereum price. VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000. When writing, ETH trades at $2,440, up by 8% in the past seven days.¬† Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",0.15,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T16:45:12.105332+00:00,

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you&rsquo;ll wish you had one.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.</strong></em></p></p>

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin.

Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you&rsquo;ll wish you had one.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.</strong></em></p></p>

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you&rsquo;ll wish you had one.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.</strong></em></p></p>

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin.

Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least. This gives time and most importantly, confidence in risk assets such as Bitcoin for investors looking for gains. With the return of investors into the risk market, the Bitcoin price could quickly cross $110,000 as early as Wednesday.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Technically, SOL is attempting to break a multi-month downtrend and is forming a higher high structure for the first time since late December.

Until then, traders will closely watch the $181 level for a decisive breakout or rejection.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.</p><p>Seasonality may also play a role. The adage &ldquo;Sell in May and go away&rdquo; has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades <a href=""https://x.com/DaanCrypto/status/1922261040206905361"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">noted</a>, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well. Many investors are watching the same thing after all.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Whether this rally has more room to run&mdash;or is due for a breather&mdash;may soon be put to the test.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least. This gives time and most importantly, confidence in risk assets such as Bitcoin for investors looking for gains. With the return of investors into the risk market, the Bitcoin price could quickly cross $110,000 as early as Wednesday.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Technically, SOL is attempting to break a multi-month downtrend and is forming a higher high structure for the first time since late December. The convergence of the moving averages suggests a pivotal moment. If buyers step in with conviction, a move toward $200 becomes likely. Until then, traders will closely watch the $181 level for a decisive breakout or rejection.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark.

This shift has reignited capital inflows, which exceeded $1 billion per day, suggesting strong demand-side interest and a market willing to absorb selling pressure.

Since May 12, major US indexes gained 3% to 4% on positive developments in US-China trade relations, but Bitcoin barely budged.

If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.</p><p>Seasonality may also play a role. The adage &ldquo;Sell in May and go away&rdquo; has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades <a href=""https://x.com/DaanCrypto/status/1922261040206905361"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">noted</a>, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well. Many investors are watching the same thing after all.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Whether this rally has more room to run&mdash;or is due for a breather&mdash;may soon be put to the test.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Technically, SOL is attempting to break a multi-month downtrend and is forming a higher high structure for the first time since late December. The convergence of the moving averages suggests a pivotal moment. If buyers step in with conviction, a move toward $200 becomes likely. Until then, traders will closely watch the $181 level for a decisive breakout or rejection.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.</p><p>Seasonality may also play a role. The adage &ldquo;Sell in May and go away&rdquo; has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades <a href=""https://x.com/DaanCrypto/status/1922261040206905361"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">noted</a>, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well. Many investors are watching the same thing after all.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Whether this rally has more room to run&mdash;or is due for a breather&mdash;may soon be put to the test.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Technically, SOL is attempting to break a multi-month downtrend and is forming a higher high structure for the first time since late December. The convergence of the moving averages suggests a pivotal moment. If buyers step in with conviction, a move toward $200 becomes likely. Until then, traders will closely watch the $181 level for a decisive breakout or rejection.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.</p><p>Seasonality may also play a role. The adage &ldquo;Sell in May and go away&rdquo; has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades <a href=""https://x.com/DaanCrypto/status/1922261040206905361"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">noted</a>, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well. Many investors are watching the same thing after all.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Whether this rally has more room to run&mdash;or is due for a breather&mdash;may soon be put to the test.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Technically, SOL is attempting to break a multi-month downtrend and is forming a higher high structure for the first time since late December. The convergence of the moving averages suggests a pivotal moment. If buyers step in with conviction, a move toward $200 becomes likely. Until then, traders will closely watch the $181 level for a decisive breakout or rejection.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.</p><p>Seasonality may also play a role. The adage &ldquo;Sell in May and go away&rdquo; has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades <a href=""https://x.com/DaanCrypto/status/1922261040206905361"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">noted</a>, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you&rsquo;ll wish you had one.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.</strong></em></p></p>

News,Bitcoin,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Surge To $120,000 And Then A 50% Crash To $60,000, Here‚Äôs When. The Bitcoin price is once again at the center of attention as it continues its upward climb in what appears to be the final phase of the current bull cycle. Riding on the back of macroeconomic optimism and institutional interest, Bitcoin is showing renewed strength, with technical analysis forecasting a final pump to a new ATH above $120,000. Once the flagship cryptocurrency completes this move, its price is forecasted to crash down to $60,000, signaling the onset of the bear market.¬† Bitcoin Price To Surpass $120,000 In 2025 Xanrox, a crypto analyst, has shared a new Bitcoin price prediction on TradingView, forecasting a bullish run to a new all-time high and a subsequent crash to major lows. Expanding on his optimistic projection, the crypto analyst has confirmed that Bitcoin is in the final stages of this bullish cycle, meaning that the cryptocurrency is gearing up for its most explosive price surge yet. Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 The analyst shared an Elliott Wave technical chart, indicating that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 3 of a five-wave pattern forming an ending diagonal. This structure typically marks the final stage of a bullish cycle, just before a major correction.¬† Xanrox predicts that Bitcoin will eventually enter two final wave stages (Wave 4 and 5) before reaching a cycle peak. According to his analysis, the ideal range for this bull run lies between $120,000 and $125,000. More precisely, he highlights a Fibonacci Extension target of 1.618 at $122,069 as the potential top of this bull cycle.¬† The TradingView analyst also notes that this Fibonacci target is the best price to sell and prepare for the bear market that‚Äôs projected to follow. Notably, this price level aligns with a long-term trend line that stretches from Bitcoin‚Äôs 2017 peak to the 2021 top and the next forecasted 2025 ATH.¬† Strengthening the analyst‚Äôs conviction of a potential rally to $122,069, Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price behavior reveals a consistent relationship with the 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA). The analysis highlights that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly bounced off or corrected to this moving average during key turning points in past cycles. This pattern adds further credibility to the bullish outlook.¬† Next Up: 50% Price Crash To $60,000 Despite Xanrox‚Äôs optimistic price projection for 2025, the analyst warns of an impending Bitcoin market crash in 2026. Once the cryptocurrency completes its final bullish wave and tops out, the analyst anticipates a steep correction, potentially dragging the price down to $60,000. This projected 50% drop mirrors past cycle declines, particularly the sharp correction seen in the 2018 and 2022 bear markets.¬† Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $150,000: BTC Is Mirroring Bullish Fractal From 2020 The analyst‚Äôs chart identifies this looming price crash as part of the natural end to Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-year cycle, emphasizing that buying at the projected peak of $122,069 could expose investors to significant downside risk. Instead, Xanrox recommends preparing for this bearish transition by exiting the market within the previously outlined sell zone and waiting for a re-entry opportunity during the expected 2026 dip.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Technically, SOL is attempting to break a multi-month downtrend and is forming a higher high structure for the first time since late December.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

Since May 12, major US indexes gained 3% to 4% on positive developments in US-China trade relations, but Bitcoin barely budged.

If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.</p><p>Seasonality may also play a role. The adage &ldquo;Sell in May and go away&rdquo; has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades <a href=""https://x.com/DaanCrypto/status/1922261040206905361"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">noted</a>, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well.

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you&rsquo;ll wish you had one.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.</strong></em></p></p>

News,Bitcoin,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Surge To $120,000 And Then A 50% Crash To $60,000, Here‚Äôs When. The Bitcoin price is once again at the center of attention as it continues its upward climb in what appears to be the final phase of the current bull cycle. Riding on the back of macroeconomic optimism and institutional interest, Bitcoin is showing renewed strength, with technical analysis forecasting a final pump to a new ATH above $120,000. Once the flagship cryptocurrency completes this move, its price is forecasted to crash down to $60,000, signaling the onset of the bear market.¬† Bitcoin Price To Surpass $120,000 In 2025 Xanrox, a crypto analyst, has shared a new Bitcoin price prediction on TradingView, forecasting a bullish run to a new all-time high and a subsequent crash to major lows. Expanding on his optimistic projection, the crypto analyst has confirmed that Bitcoin is in the final stages of this bullish cycle, meaning that the cryptocurrency is gearing up for its most explosive price surge yet. Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 The analyst shared an Elliott Wave technical chart, indicating that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 3 of a five-wave pattern forming an ending diagonal. This structure typically marks the final stage of a bullish cycle, just before a major correction.¬† Xanrox predicts that Bitcoin will eventually enter two final wave stages (Wave 4 and 5) before reaching a cycle peak. According to his analysis, the ideal range for this bull run lies between $120,000 and $125,000. More precisely, he highlights a Fibonacci Extension target of 1.618 at $122,069 as the potential top of this bull cycle.¬† The TradingView analyst also notes that this Fibonacci target is the best price to sell and prepare for the bear market that‚Äôs projected to follow. Notably, this price level aligns with a long-term trend line that stretches from Bitcoin‚Äôs 2017 peak to the 2021 top and the next forecasted 2025 ATH.¬† Strengthening the analyst‚Äôs conviction of a potential rally to $122,069, Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price behavior reveals a consistent relationship with the 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA). The analysis highlights that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly bounced off or corrected to this moving average during key turning points in past cycles. This pattern adds further credibility to the bullish outlook.¬† Next Up: 50% Price Crash To $60,000 Despite Xanrox‚Äôs optimistic price projection for 2025, the analyst warns of an impending Bitcoin market crash in 2026. Once the cryptocurrency completes its final bullish wave and tops out, the analyst anticipates a steep correction, potentially dragging the price down to $60,000. This projected 50% drop mirrors past cycle declines, particularly the sharp correction seen in the 2018 and 2022 bear markets.¬† Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $150,000: BTC Is Mirroring Bullish Fractal From 2020 The analyst‚Äôs chart identifies this looming price crash as part of the natural end to Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-year cycle, emphasizing that buying at the projected peak of $122,069 could expose investors to significant downside risk. Instead, Xanrox recommends preparing for this bearish transition by exiting the market within the previously outlined sell zone and waiting for a re-entry opportunity during the expected 2026 dip.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease.

They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.
