At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.</em></p><h2>Ways to earn yield on Bitcoin</h2><p>While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"">bridging</a> BTC to other blockchains.</p><h3>Centralized lending platforms</h3><p>Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"">collapse of firms</a> like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability.&nbsp;</p><h3>WBTC on Ethereum</h3><p>WBTC is an <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"">ERC-20 token</a> backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo).

This unlocks DeFi&rsquo;s potential but introduces risks from BitGo&rsquo;s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.</p><h3>Bitcoin layer-2 platforms</h3><p>Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin&rsquo;s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after &ldquo;the Merge,&rdquo; replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain&rsquo;s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.</em></p><h2>How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform</h2><p>Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.</p><p>Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.</p></li></ul><p>Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.</p><figure><img alt=""Stake BTC on Binance Earn"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36c-448c-7d76-b618-b502aba3d789"" title="""" /></figure><p>After subscribing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term&rsquo;s end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.</p></li></ul><p>Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.</p><h2>How to earn yield with WBTC on Ethereum</h2><p>WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum&rsquo;s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"">liquidity pools</a> and earning interest or fees.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Convert BTC to WBTC:</strong> Use a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"">centralized exchange (CEX)</a> (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transfer WBTC to a wallet:</strong> Move WBTC to a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"">Web3</a> wallet like <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"">MetaMask</a> and make sure you have enough Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"">gas fees</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect to a DeFi protocol:</strong> Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform&rsquo;s interface.</p></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Connect your wallet to Aave platform"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36d-bb40-714c-bdc9-e4ff139bd2fc"" title="""" /></figure><ul><li><p><strong>Earn yield:</strong> By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.</p></li></ul><h2>How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2s</h2><p>Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon&rsquo;s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with Babylon:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up a compatible wallet:</strong> Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses.

Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em> <em>In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.</em></p><h2>Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocols</h2><p>Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security.</p><h3>Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol</h3><p>Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.</p><h3>Stacking in the Stacks Protocol</h3><p>Stacking is Stacks&rsquo; yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"">STX</a>) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.</p><h2>Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained</h2><p>Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"">deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns</a> for institutional investors outside the US.&nbsp;</p><p>The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"">spot and futures markets</a>, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting annual net returns of 4&ndash;8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin &mdash; an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Risks involved in earning yield with BTC</h2><p>Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Custodial risk:</strong> Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC&rsquo;s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network maturity:</strong> Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market risk:</strong> Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>How earning yield with BTC may evolve</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin&rsquo;s censorship resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you?

By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded.

The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T22:45:11.392486+00:00,

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin continued its climb past $104,000 on Monday, and that rally has tempted some big traders to bet against it. A few high-stakes short positions now sit on the brink of collapse. These trades carry skinny margins for error and show just how risky huge margin bets can be when price momentum stays strong. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Massive Short Position At Risk According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, one whale wallet opened a $93 million short with 40√ó margin. At Bitcoin‚Äôs current level near $104,000, just a 1.5% uptick would force a shutdown at around $105,700. That means a small move could wipe it out. Right now, that position is sitting on over $500,000 in paper losses. It‚Äôs also earning about $34,000 in funding fees. But those earnings are tiny next to the loss, so they barely ease the pain. Many gamblers are shorting $BTC with high leverage! 0x51d9 opened a $93M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $105,690. 0x5D2F opened a $44M short position on $BTC with 40x leverage, with a liquidation price of $112,660.https://t.co/WcW1u4FdWz‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/pAf1LEMnZp ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 12, 2025 Second Whale Holding At Crossroads Another account took a $44 million short at $103,494.40, again using 40√ó cross margin. Now that Bitcoin trades around $104,720, the trade is down roughly $515,348.53. Its liquidation threshold is much further out, at about $112,660. That gives a buffer of close to $9,000 before it‚Äôs wiped out. So far, this trader has pocketed $51,711.71 in positive funding. Those credits show that traders are still betting on higher prices overall. Yet if Bitcoin‚Äôs climb stays on track, that buffer could evaporate fast. Failed Bet Already Closed A third whale got burned even sooner. This trader sold short $69.7 million worth of Bitcoin at $95,969, using 40√ó margin. Their cut-off price was $103,470. Bitcoin crossed that line days ago, trading above $104,000 in recent sessions. Based on reports, that position has almost certainly been liquidated already. It serves as proof of just how quickly high-risk shorts can backfire when prices shoot up. Liquidations Highlight Market Pressure Over the past 12 hours, Bitcoin derivatives saw $66.66 million in liquidations, with $51.25 million coming from shorts. In the full 24-hour stretch, a total of $82.58 million was wiped out, and $60.97 million of that was on the short side. Longs only accounted for $21 million in closures. These figures underline how much buying power has been forced back into the market, fueling further gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details This frenzy shows that betting big against Bitcoin‚Äôs rally can end badly and fast. Small funding payments won‚Äôt make up for big losses if price keeps rising. Traders taking huge short positions now face steep odds of getting squeezed out.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend?. Ethereum (ETH) has surged over 40% in the past two weeks, trading in the mid-$2,000 range at the time of writing. Notably, several key indicators suggest that the ongoing ETH rally is being driven more by spot market demand than leveraged trading &#8211; an encouraging sign of a potentially sustainable bull run. Ethereum Rally Driven By Spot Demand After lagging behind other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP for much of the past year, ETH is now showing signs of an organic uptrend. According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanMarkets, the current momentum appears to be primarily spot-driven, rather than fueled by speculative futures trading. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, ShayanMarkets highlighted that ETH funding rates have remained ‚Äòrelatively flat‚Äô despite the price surge. This is significant because funding rates are typically a reflection of sentiment in the perpetual futures market. To explain, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price of the asset. Positive funding rates indicate that long positions are paying shorts, typically signaling bullish market sentiment, while negative rates suggest bearish sentiment. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, flat funding rates during this recent rally indicate that the upward price action is being powered by genuine buying in the spot market, not speculative leverage. This makes the uptrend less prone to sudden reversals triggered by mass liquidations. As ShayanMarkets noted: Still, for the bullish momentum to be sustained and validated, funding rates should begin to rise, reflecting increased confidence and more aggressive positioning by futures traders. Meanwhile, other analysts predict further upside for ETH. For instance, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently remarked that if ETH can decisively break through the $2,380 resistance level, then it could enter a new bull rally. In his latest X post, Martinez emphasized that ETH‚Äôs new critical support range lies between $2,060 and $2,420. The analyst noted that close to 10 million wallets hold more than 69 million ETH between these levels. New ETH ATH On The Horizon? Although Ethereum remains well below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 reached in November 2021, many market watchers believe a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòInsanely Undervalued‚Äô As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking ‚Äì Is A Rally Imminent? In the same vein, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto recently noted that ETH is following a V-shape recovery. The analyst shared the following weekly chart that compares BTC and ETH price action, predicting that ETH is likely to follow BTC‚Äôs trajectory. Meanwhile, analyst Ted Pillows outlined five bullish factors that could push ETH to $12,000 in 2025 &#8211; including favorable regulatory developments and strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETF). At press time, ETH trades at $2,555, up 3% in the past 24 hours.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Dips: Healthy Cooldown or Warning Sign of Bigger Trouble?. Ethereum price extended its increase above the $2,500 zone. ETH is now correcting gains and might revisit the $2,350 support zone. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $2,600 resistance. The price is trading above $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could find bids near $2,350 and start a fresh increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Fresh Increase Ethereum price remained supported and started a fresh increase above $2,350, beating Bitcoin. ETH gained pace for a move above the $2,400 resistance zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the $2,550 resistance zone. The price gained over 35% and recently tested the $2,600 resistance zone. A high was formed at $2,624 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a minor decline below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,272 swing low to the $2,624 high. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bulls are still active above $2,400. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,500 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,620 level. A clear move above the $2,620 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,780 in the near term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal. Bitcoin has continued its upward trend, recording a weekly price increase of 10.4% and currently trading at $103,881. The asset has surged over 24% in the last month, fueled by growing optimism across both crypto and traditional markets. Although still about 4% below its January all-time high, the latest developments suggest that bullish momentum may be building again. This renewed price strength appears to be supported by significant capital movements, including a notable Bitcoin outflow from the Binance exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Suggest Accumulation Phase According to recent data shared on CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform by analyst Amr Taha, over 3,000 BTC, valued at approximately $312 million, was withdrawn from Binance on May 12, marking one of the largest daily outflows in recent months. This coincided with a key macroeconomic development: a new trade agreement between the United States and China, which also sparked a sharp rebound in US equity markets, with the S&#38;P 500 jumping more than 3%. Taha‚Äôs analysis indicates that this substantial Bitcoin withdrawal is part of a broader trend. Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have declined consistently, falling from approximately 595,000 BTC in late February to 541,400 BTC by mid-May. The ongoing reduction in exchange balances typically signals a preference among investors for cold storage solutions or private wallets. Historically, such moves are viewed as indicative of accumulation behavior, suggesting lower near-term selling pressure and a more bullish medium-term outlook. The timing of the withdrawal, immediately following a geopolitical breakthrough between two of the world‚Äôs largest economies, adds further context. Taha highlights that capital markets responded positively to the easing of US-China tariff tensions, and the corresponding activity in the crypto space suggests Bitcoin investors are aligning their strategies accordingly. With macro uncertainty temporarily subdued, large holders appear to be repositioning for potential future gains, removing liquidity from exchanges to mitigate exposure and reduce immediate sell-side pressure. Macro Trends Influence Market Positioning The analyst further noted that market participants seem to be increasingly responsive to macro signals. The scale of the BTC withdrawal on May 12, paired with rising equity markets, illustrates how capital is shifting across asset classes in response to broader economic developments. Taha suggests this coordinated movement reflects renewed risk appetite and a possible recalibration of investor strategies in light of improving global trade dynamics. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Bears Losing Out? $31 Million Wiped Out In BTC Shorts Liquidation While it remains to be seen whether this momentum can be sustained, recent patterns support the view that long-term holders and institutional participants are gaining confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s role within a diversified investment strategy. As traditional markets recover and geopolitical risks ease, Bitcoin&#8217;s reduced exchange reserves and growing off-exchange holdings may lay the groundwork for another test of its all-time high. The coming weeks will likely be crucial in determining whether current inflows translate into a full-scale breakout or a period of consolidation.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run?. Data shows the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has remained outside the extreme greed zone even after the price surge above $104,000. Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index Is Still Inside Greed Territory The &#8220;Fear &#38; Greed Index&#8221; refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Whales Sitting On 185% Higher Cost Basis Than HODLer Whales, Data Shows The metric makes use of the data of the following five factors to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the market sentiment, the index uses a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values under 47 suggest the dominance of fear in the market, while those above 53 imply that of greed. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special regions known as the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above a value of 75, while the latter below 26. Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index is like: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear &#38; Greed Index has a value of 70 at the moment, which suggests the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. This greedy mentality is also decently strong, as it&#8217;s only a few units away from the extreme greed territory. Earlier in the month, the trader mentality declined to a neutral level as the price surge took a pause, but with the latest continuation to the rally, the market mood has improved once more. Interestingly, though, despite Bitcoin approaching its all-time high (ATH), the investors have still not become extremely greedy. If history is to go by, this could actually play into the favor of the asset&#8217;s price. The reason behind this is that the cryptocurrency has often tended to move in a direction that&#8217;s opposite to the crowd opinion. The probability of such a contrary move taking place has only gone up the more sure the investors become of a direction, so the extreme zones, where sentiment is the strongest, is where major tops and bottoms have formed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives In The Driver‚Äôs Seat For $100,000 Rally, Data Shows The Fear &#38; Greed Index still staying out of the extreme greed region could be an indication that an excess of hype hasn&#8217;t developed among the investors just yet, so Bitcoin could potentially have more room to run before a top. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly managed to cross beyond the $105,000 level earlier, but it seems the coin has seen a small pullback since then as its price is now back at $103,000.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Surges 50%: Top Expert Declares It The Best Crypto To Buy Now. The Ethereum price has crossed the $2,400 mark for the first time since March of this year, marking a significant recovery for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.¬† This surge represents a remarkable 50% increase over the past month, notably outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) 19% rise during the same period. As a result, market experts are increasingly viewing Ethereum as the premier cryptocurrency to invest. Ethereum Price Potential Soars Notably, VirtualBacon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, recently asserted, ‚ÄúEthereum is the best crypto to buy right now.‚Äù He emphasized that while the Ethereum price may not have surged as dramatically as some other cryptocurrencies, its fundamental strengths remain intact.¬† In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), VirtualBacon highlighted his updated timeline and targets for the Ethereum price, noting that the cryptocurrency is trading near $2,500, a significant recovery from its lows in 2022 reached during the market sell-off in April. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends According to the analyst, a key indicator of Ethereum&#8217;s potential is the ETH/BTC trading pair, which recently rebounded from multi-year support levels. Historically, such bounces have often signaled the onset of altcoin cycles, aligning with shifts in global liquidity.¬† VirtualBacon asserts that if the Ethereum price can reclaim the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level against Bitcoin, it could see a substantial gain of approximately 60%. A further retracement to the 0.5 level would push its value beyond 0.05 BTC, enhancing the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Currently, the Ethereum price is consolidating around these critical levels, which are viewed as a strong accumulation range before macroeconomic conditions shift.¬† VirtualBacon Projects $10K For ETH The analyst also argued that while Solana (SOL) is faster in terms of transaction speeds, Ethereum remains the backbone for most real-world applications (RWAs) and stablecoins. It is also the only altcoin recognized as a commodity in legal terms, gaining trust from institutional investors. Related Reading: XRP Chart Hits Critical Level That ‚ÄòOpens The Sky,‚Äô Analyst Warns Looking ahead, Ethereum&#8217;s future performance is closely tied to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed) monetary policy decisions. With quantitative tightening (QT) slowing to $5 billion per month‚Äîthe lowest rate in recent history‚Äîthe analyst is keenly anticipating a potential pause in QT by the third or fourth quarter of this year.¬† VirtualBacon forecasts that this pause could trigger a bottoming out of the ETH/BTC pair, paving the way for significant upside movement for the Ethereum price. VirtualBacon maintains a bullish outlook for Ethereum, suggesting that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, ETH could hit a price target of $10,000. If Bitcoin climbs even higher to $250,000, the Ethereum price could soar to $12,000.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400. Ethereum is following the broader crypto market rally with renewed momentum, registering a 38.2% increase in the past week. At the time of writing, ETH is trading above $2,400, continuing its upward trajectory and narrowing the gap between its current price and its all-time high of $4,878 recorded in 2021. The asset‚Äôs recent performance has placed it firmly in line with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, benefiting from revived market confidence. On-chain activity is also beginning to reflect these price movements, especially among Ethereum stakers. According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n, Ethereum stakers have returned to a state of unrealized profits following a prolonged period of holding at a loss. This shift, the analyst notes, could play a role in shaping the next phase of Ethereum‚Äôs market dynamics as staking participants regain confidence in the network‚Äôs long-term outlook. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Realized Price and Stakeholder Sentiment In his post titled ‚ÄúFrom Red to Green: Ethereum Stakers Are Back in Profit,‚Äù Alem√°n explained that staked tokens behave differently from regular circulating supply, remaining mostly static and thus excluded from metrics that rely on liquidity or transfer activity. This difference is essential in understanding metrics like the Realized Price, which calculates the average acquisition cost of a given cohort. Since March 3, 2025, Ethereum stakers have been operating under unrealized losses, with the Realized Price at $2,279 and the market price falling to $2,149. However, that changed on May 9, 2025, when the market price of ETH reached $2,297, pushing the staked cohort back into profitability. At that moment, the updated Realized Price stood at $2,276, indicating that a majority of staked tokens were once again held above their cost basis. The renewed profitability could reduce selling pressure and strengthen the resolve of validators and long-term holders who form the backbone of Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus model. Implications for Ethereum‚Äôs Ecosystem The return to unrealized profits among Ethereum stakers may signal broader positive implications for the network. Alem√°n emphasized that staked ETH is not only held by individuals seeking yield, but also plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum‚Äôs network security through validator participation. The shift back into profit territory may encourage new staking activity while discouraging premature withdrawals or profit-taking, helping to stabilize the supply side of the market. Related Reading: Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst In addition to individual stakers, institutions and Layer 2 protocol participants may interpret this trend as a bullish indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs future trajectory. Alem√°n noted: This type of price recovery has the potential to trigger new waves of accumulation and participation in the network, further enhancing its security and long-term stability. If ETH maintains this upward trend, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new bullish cycle for Ethereum and its most committed actors, including L2 solutions and other ecosystem players.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next?. After jumping by 10% over the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a crucial resistance level, which could push or momentarily halt the flagship crypto‚Äôs rally toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details Bitcoin Hits Key Level Bitcoin recently jumped above the $100,000 barrier for the first time since February. During its significant weekly performance, BTC has surged over 10% to hit a three-month high of $105,500 on Monday, fueling investors‚Äô sentiment regarding a new ATH rally. On Monday, Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that the flagship crypto rallied across the entire re-accumulation range, concluding its downside deviation and the first price discovery correction. After surging to its range high of $104,500, Bitcoin has faced rejection from this key level, momentarily pausing its rally. He pointed out that Bitcoin already had its first Price Discovery Uptrend and Price Discovery Correction. The cryptocurrency is now attempting to confirm its second Price Discovery Uptrend, but needs to reclaim the $104,500 level as support to confirm this phase. As the analyst explained, this level is currently acting as resistance after it closed the week at $104,118, just below the range high. He added that ‚Äútechnically BTC can try to confirm an uptrend beyond this point by Daily Closing above $104.5k and then holding it as support, so it will be worth watching for this lower timeframe confirmation.‚Äù However, ‚Äúuntil that confirmation is in, this resistance will continue to act as one. And as resistances do, they tend to reject price.‚Äù According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has repeated some key elements from its Post-halving range in its current range, suggesting that if BTC continues to reject from this level, it could face a post-breakout retest of its lower high resistance. One Dip Left Before ATHs? Previously, the analyst detailed that BTC could be repeating its Q4 2024 performance, where the cryptocurrency recovered from its downside deviation to hit a new ATH. BTC initially got rejected at its lower high resistance and fell to the range‚Äôs lows before breaking above the lower high, retesting it as support, and soaring to a new ATH. For history to repeat, BTC must get rejected at $99,000, hold $93,500 as support, and break the $97,000-$99,000 range before being rejected at the $104,500 resistance, which is the level ‚Äúto turn into support for Bitcoin to breakout into its second Price Discovery Uptrend.‚Äù Notably, BTC followed this path closely over the past week, getting rejected near $99,000 and retesting the $93,500 support before jumping above the $100,000 mark. To continue this performance, the cryptocurrency must fall to the $97,000-$99,000 range and hold it as support for a similar breakout to new ATHs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next In his Monday analysis, Rekt Capital shared that BTC‚Äôs lower high resistance is at the $98,500 level, signaling that a 5% drop could be ahead. However, he noted that the retest ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt need to happen at all,‚Äù as Bitcoin could Daily Close above the key resistance, hold this level, and rally to new ATHs. ‚ÄúBut in the event of a dip, turning the Lower High resistance into a new support could fully confirm the break of this Lower High, turn it into new support, and in doing so, solidify BTC&#8217;s positioning in the $98.5k-$104.5k portion of the ReAccumulation Range,‚Äù he concluded.

News,Bitcoin,"Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000. The Bitcoin price and the entire crypto and stock market have been operating at the mercy of the tariff wars ignited by US President Donald Trump after being sworn into office. The initial wave of tariff increases on countries such as China triggered massive crashes across financial markets, plunging the Bitcoin price below $80,000. However, the tariff wars are nearing their end with the latest announcement from the White House regarding trade between the United States and China. White House Announces Reduction Of China Tariffs In April 2025, US President Donald Trump had announced a drastic increase of tariffs on Chinese goods to a high 145%, with over 180 countries also seeing tariff increases. This triggered a wave of panic and retaliation, triggering what is now known as the ‚Äòtariff wars.‚Äô As discussions progressed, another announcement in April revealed a 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries, with the exception of China. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge To $10: Analyst Reveals Factors That Will Make It Happen In 2025 While China was yet to exempt, the 90-day pause did have a positive effect on the market as the Bitcoin price recovered, taking the crypto market up with it. Since then, the Bitcoin price has since recovered above $100,000, as well as the stock market seeing multiple green days. Trade talks have since been ongoing between China and the United States and there has been a stopgap put in place for now. In a statement on the White House website, it was announced that both the Chinese and United States government at the US-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva had agreed to modify their respective applications and implement a suspension of 24 percentage points of tariffs. This agreement is expected to be in place for an initial period of 90 days, giving both parties time for more discussions toward a resolution. The statement read that this was done in ‚Äúthe spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect.‚Äù Why The Bitcoin Price Could Explode Currently, the rally of the Bitcoin price is being driven by the positive news surrounding the tariffs. So, it is expected that more positive news will continue to drive up the price. The agreement between the US and China states that both countries should have implemented the tariff reduction by May 14, 2025. With only a day left, this deadline could trigger another rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards As the news of the suspension begins to make the rounds, it signals no negative news coming out regarding tariffs for the next three months at least. This gives time and most importantly, confidence in risk assets such as Bitcoin for investors looking for gains.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Reclaims Center Stage With $880 Million In Inflows. Last week saw another batch of new money flowing into crypto funds. As reported by CoinShares, investment products attracted over $880 million over the course of seven days. That brings year-to-date inflows to $6.7 billion. Prices have been trending upward, with Bitcoin temporarily reaching $105,000 and Ethereum being traded above $2,600. Investors are appearing to be stepping in while the opportunity is still hot. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $104,000 Peak Sparks High-Stakes Short Positions ‚Äì Details Weekly Inflows Indicate Continued Demand According to the latest data, $882 million poured into crypto products last week. That is the fourth consecutive week of inflows. It might not rattle the broader markets, but it indicates money continues to flow in. Managers have gathered $6.7 billion in net new cash so far this year. In plain language, that&#8217;s a steady stream of new capital flowing towards these funds. Bitcoin Dominates The Inflows Bitcoin funds saw $867 million of those inflows. A big chunk of that went into US-listed ETFs. Since January 2024, those Bitcoin ETFs have gathered nearly $63 billion. They just passed their all-time high of $61.6 billion set back in February. In contrast, Ethereum products only took in $1.5 million last week. That gap shows where most investors still feel safest. Sui And Other Altcoins Catch Some Attention Some of the smaller coins were in the limelight. Sui attracted $11.7 million in just one week, surpassing Solana and Ethereum during that span. Its year-to-date figure so far stands at $84 million, narrowly over Solana&#8217;s $76 million. XRP, for its part, posted $1.4 million of weekly inflows, taking its YTD at $258 million. XRP&#8217;s assets under management are currently at $1.35 billion. Other altcoins showed only small moves, which tells us money is picking spots rather than spreading out. Source: CoinShares Regional Flows Favor The US The United States dominated all regions with $840 million of last week&#8217;s total. Germany accounted for a little over $44 million and Australia $10 million. Conversely, Sweden experienced the largest outflows at $12 million. Hong Kong lost $8 million and Canada $4.3 million. Those numbers highlight just how much the US market‚Äîled by heavy hitters such as BlackRock‚Äîis still in charge. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin ETF was the best performer, bringing in over $1 billion last week. That was partially offset by $257 million in outflows from providers like Grayscale and Bitwise. Overall, it appears that one provider&#8217;s large gain can be equaled by several others&#8217; losses. Behind the flows are broader trends in money and policy. Global M2 money supply continues to expand, adding more cash to the system. Meanwhile, concerns about slow US growth and high inflation are pushing some investors into crypto as a hedge, or alternative store of value.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000. In the latest episode of The Bitcoin Layer, host Nik Bhatia invited on-chain analyst James Check‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù‚Äîto dissect the forces that have carried bitcoin past six figures and to explain why he believes the market still points toward a move to roughly $150,000. From the outset, Check framed his analysis in sweeping macroeconomic terms. Since the 2008 financial crisis, he said, dollar strength has been ‚Äúa big up-trend‚Äù that rewarded foreign investors who benchmark in other currencies, buy dollars, and place those dollars into US equities. But that era, he argued, is giving way to a ‚Äúsound-money dominance regime‚Äù: ‚ÄúMy favorite chart is the S&#38;P 500 priced in gold. You get about ten years where equities trounce gold, then ten years where gold trounces equities. Since 2022 that chart flipped in gold‚Äôs favor, and for the first time in history we have a mature, trillion-dollar bitcoin sitting right alongside it. We‚Äôre watching the rules shift, and it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight‚Äîit‚Äôll take a decade, maybe longer, to fully play out.‚Äù Why $150,000 Is Next For Bitcoin The conversation quickly moved from macro currents to market structure. After the spring sell-off that drove prices from the mid-$90,000s to the mid-$70,000s‚Äîan ‚Äúair pocket‚Äù where little historical supply had transacted‚Äîbitcoin clawed back the dense supply cluster around $95,000 with surprising ease. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal ‚ÄúPeople were willing to just sit tight and allow the market to find its level. They‚Äôd bought at $100,000, watched it fall to $75,000, bought some more, and now they‚Äôre up on the whole stack. That kind of behavior is a real boost of confidence.‚Äù Shortly after that consolidation, the market printed a local high near $105,000. For veteran participants, the psychological shift was palpable. ‚Äú$100,000 was the target for the last decade,‚Äù Check said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs the floor. Bitcoin has proved it belongs at a trillion-dollar market cap, flipped silver, and feels perfectly natural sitting among the five largest monetary assets on earth.‚Äù Check‚Äôs quantitative framework hinges on the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which benchmarks price against the aggregated on-chain cost basis. Translating historical MVRV extremes into forward levels puts the present cycle‚Äôs statistical ceiling near $166,000: ‚ÄúIf price goes to $166,000, my objective analyst self has to say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre two standard deviations above the mean, and we‚Äôve only stayed higher than this five percent of the time.‚Äô‚Äù That band‚Äîroughly $150,000 to $160,000‚Äîmarks the altitude where he expects the first serious wave of profit-taking. Yet the level remains plausible precisely because it is rooted in realized behavior, not in the supply-halving calendar: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason MVRV only gets so high. When people look at their portfolio and see a house sitting there in green numbers, a chunk of them will hit the sell button. You don‚Äôt need everyone to sell‚Äîjust enough to overwhelm new demand.‚Äù Derivatives, ‚ÄúTime Pain‚Äù And The Halving A maturing derivatives market is central to Check‚Äôs thesis. He expects perpetual-swap funding rates to breach 20 percent annualized on a rapid run toward $150,000, inviting basis traders to short futures and collect the premium. Options desks, meanwhile, can harvest fat volatility premia by selling calls. ‚ÄúBig asset managers must hedge. If they can‚Äôt lay off a billion-dollar position in options they won‚Äôt take the position in the first place. Derivatives aren‚Äôt papering over demand‚Äîthey‚Äôre the plumbing that lets real capital scale into the asset.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends Those instruments also reshape corrections. Where 2017 pullbacks were 40% plunges that reversed in days, today‚Äôs market prefers shallower, longer consolidations‚Äîepisodes that impose what Check calls time pain. ‚ÄúDepth pain is easy to see‚Äîyour coins are 30% underwater. Time pain is harder. Three months of chop at the same level will wear investors out, and boredom is a powerful seller.‚Äù Perhaps one of the most striking element of the interview was Check‚Äôs deliberate break from the four-year, halving-centric cycle model. After studying the August‚ÄìSeptember 2023 pullback, the mid-2024 range, and the latest sell-off, he concluded that the short-term-holder cost basis now functions less as a binary floor or ceiling and more as a mean-reversion anchor. ‚ÄúPeople are now using bitcoin to respond to the world rather than us responding to bitcoin. Macro sentiment‚Äînot scheduled supply shocks‚Äîis steering the big flows.‚Äù Treasury Adoption And The Confidence Machine When tracking corporate treasuries, ETFs, and other large holders, Check zooms out to a 30-day change in realized cap‚Äîthe cleanest view of net dollar inflows. Even March-April ETF outflows, he noted, were nearly matched by falling CME open interest, implying ‚Äúmechanical cash-and-carry unwinds rather than lost conviction.‚Äù Closing the conversation, he returned to first principles: ‚ÄúMarkets are a big confidence machine. The dollar cycle, the gold-equity rotation, the cost of hedging‚Äîall of that feeds straight into bitcoin order books, option smiles, and on-chain ledgers. The only real question is: what‚Äôs the fair macro premium for digital sound money?‚Äù For James Check, the chart already sketches an answer: somewhere around $150,000, the confidence machine will stage its next major test. At press time, BTC traded at $102,573. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.11,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T14:45:10.115310+00:00,

In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; that so many others claim it to be.</p><p>With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn&rsquo;t it also rallying as investors seek safety?</p><p>Even in today&rsquo;s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge &mdash; arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strength in scarcity</h2><p>Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.</p><p>Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It&rsquo;s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus &mdash; not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Consensus beats centralization</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s value isn&rsquo;t just in its price &mdash; it&rsquo;s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.</p><p>Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries &mdash; rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It&rsquo;s not theoretical anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s happening in real life.</p><p>During Greece&rsquo;s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-rival-gold-as-inflation-hedge-adam-back""><em><strong>Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade &mdash; Adam Back</strong></em></a></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It&rsquo;s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command.&nbsp;</p><p>Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing &mdash; and may not appreciate until they need it the most.&nbsp;</p><h2>Portability is power</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s resilience also matters in developed markets &mdash; especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin&rsquo;s availability and independence became its advantage.</p><p>In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control &mdash; as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.</p><p>Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints &mdash; and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It&rsquo;s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze &mdash; giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.</p><h2>A more nuanced term: speculative hedge&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin&rsquo;s central role in our financial futures.</p><p>A more precise term might be speculative hedge &mdash; it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy &mdash; with<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/25-percent-sp-500-firms-will-own-bitcoin-by-2030"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> some estimates</a> pointing to one in four companies in the S&amp;P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/czech-national-bank-governor-proposes-7b-bitcoin-reserve-plan"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> exploring Bitcoin reserves</a>.</p><p>As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely &mdash; say, during a nuclear war &mdash; there will be bigger problems than inflation.</p><p>Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It&rsquo;s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It&rsquo;s a small measure of preparation for life&rsquo;s unknowns.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching. Dogecoin‚Äôs revival from the late-April trough at $0.1298 to Monday‚Äôs intraday spike at roughly $0.2597 has thrust the original meme-asset into a technically decisive arena, inspiring three top market technicians to publish fresh views. What&#8217;s Next For Dogecoin? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez plots a 12-hour DOGE/USD chart that frames a supply band between $0.25 and $0.27. That zone supported price in December 2024 and February 2025 three times, but flipped to resistance after late February‚Äôs breakdown, a role it has repeated in every rally since. Martinez marks each failed thrust with black arrows and notes the most recent 12-hour close at $0.24903 sitting inside the band. In his words, ‚ÄúDogecoin has reached a crucial area of resistance!‚Äù Until bulls print decisive closes above the upper boundary at $0.27, the region remains a potential turning point. Rekt Capital zooms out to the weekly time-frame and points to a horizontal pivot at $0.22014, labelled ‚ÄúPre-Halving resistance‚Äù on his DOGE/USDT chart. After reclaiming that level, price is now dipping back toward it, a move the analyst calls ‚Äúthat key retest of Pre-Halving resistance into new support ‚Ä¶ Retest is now in progress. Hold green and at least $0.27 would be next.‚Äù Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The green support box extends roughly $0.19‚Äì$0.22 and sits atop an 18-month rising trend-line that converges near $0.15901. A weekly defence of this cluster would open the way to the next resistances Rekt Capital plots at $0.27884 and $0.33817. Bitcoinsensus focuses on momentum, overlaying a weekly MACD on his DOGE/USDT chart. The fast line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line for the first time since late-2024. He highlights that the previous two bullish crossovers preceded rallies of ‚âà +165 % (to $0.23) and ‚âà +330 % (to $0.48). Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Citing that pattern, the analyst writes: ‚ÄúDOGE BULLISH MACD CROSS ‚Ä¶ Next Price Target : $0.72.‚Äù His chart projects a parabolic path toward $0.72, while a dotted ascending baseline anchored in March 2024 still underpins the structure in the mid-$0.15 region. Collectively the three studies leave Dogecoin at an inflection point. A clean break above $0.27 would neutralise the multi-month supply zone highlighted by Martinez and validate Rekt Capital‚Äôs next weekly objectives. Failure to sustain that level, or a weekly close back under $0.22, would refocus attention on the trend-line and horizontal support in the high-$0.15s. For momentum traders, confirmation of the looming MACD crossover could be the trigger that sets the stage for Bitcoinsensus‚Äô lofty $0.72 projection. For now, participants watch whether the meme-coin‚Äôs latest bark translates into another bite. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22485.

News,Solana,"Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst. Solana has rallied more than 22% since last Thursday, riding the wave of renewed bullish momentum across the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin pushes toward all-time highs and Ethereum breaks key resistance levels, Solana has followed suit with impressive strength. The price surged to a local high of $181 before encountering resistance, where it now consolidates just below that mark, searching for support to fuel the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? While price action cools at a pivotal level, on-chain data shows significant growth in Solana‚Äôs user base. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million in the past two weeks. This rapid increase in smallholder wallets points to a rising wave of adoption and network participation, particularly as interest in altcoins intensifies. Solana‚Äôs consolidation just under $181 may act as a healthy pause before a continuation if bullish momentum persists. With the market heating up and retail interest returning, the current price structure could offer the foundation for a strong breakout in the coming sessions. The combination of price performance and rising user engagement suggests Solana may be positioning for a larger role in the next phase of the bull cycle. Solana Holds Key Support As Wallet Growth Signals Optimism Solana is now facing a crucial test as it consolidates just below the $181 resistance zone. After a sharp 22% rally over the past week, bulls must defend current levels to validate the uptrend and sustain momentum. Holding above the $170‚Äì$175 support range would confirm strength and could pave the way for a renewed push toward the $200 level. However, the path forward isn‚Äôt without risk. The broader macroeconomic environment remains fragile, with persistent fears of a global slowdown and continued uncertainty around inflation and interest rate policy. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market is staging a powerful recovery, and Solana is among the top performers. This rally may be more than just a short-term bounce‚Äîit could mark the early stages of a larger bullish phase with significant upside potential. Investor sentiment is improving, and so is user engagement across key ecosystems. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling on-chain data that reinforces this perspective. According to Glassnode, the number of wallets holding 0.1 SOL or more has surged to 11.04 million over the last two weeks. This rapid growth in smaller holders suggests growing retail interest and a widening user base‚Äîcritical indicators for long-term strength. If bulls can maintain control at current levels and macro conditions don‚Äôt worsen, Solana could be poised for a major move. The combination of technical momentum and on-chain engagement provides a strong foundation for the next leg higher. All eyes are now on whether the $181 resistance breaks‚Äîor if Solana needs more time to build strength before the next phase of the rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support Solana Faces Resistance As Price Pulls Back To Retest Support Solana (SOL) is consolidating just below the $181 level after a strong 22% rally from last week. As shown in the chart, price action surged above both the 200-day EMA ($161.88) and 200-day SMA ($181.11), signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, the current pullback from $180 to around $173.48 shows that the $181 level is acting as a key resistance, which has previously served as a rejection zone multiple times in the past. Volume remains healthy, and the recent move shows strong market participation, but bulls now need to hold the $170‚Äì$172 range to maintain control. A successful retest of this area as support could set the stage for a breakout above $181. Failing to hold above this zone, however, could trigger a correction back to the $160‚Äì$165 region, near the 200 EMA. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Technically, SOL is attempting to break a multi-month downtrend and is forming a higher high structure for the first time since late December. The convergence of the moving averages suggests a pivotal moment. If buyers step in with conviction, a move toward $200 becomes likely. Until then, traders will closely watch the $181 level for a decisive breakout or rejection.

News,Bitcoin,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Surge To $120,000 And Then A 50% Crash To $60,000, Here‚Äôs When. The Bitcoin price is once again at the center of attention as it continues its upward climb in what appears to be the final phase of the current bull cycle. Riding on the back of macroeconomic optimism and institutional interest, Bitcoin is showing renewed strength, with technical analysis forecasting a final pump to a new ATH above $120,000. Once the flagship cryptocurrency completes this move, its price is forecasted to crash down to $60,000, signaling the onset of the bear market.¬† Bitcoin Price To Surpass $120,000 In 2025 Xanrox, a crypto analyst, has shared a new Bitcoin price prediction on TradingView, forecasting a bullish run to a new all-time high and a subsequent crash to major lows. Expanding on his optimistic projection, the crypto analyst has confirmed that Bitcoin is in the final stages of this bullish cycle, meaning that the cryptocurrency is gearing up for its most explosive price surge yet. Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 The analyst shared an Elliott Wave technical chart, indicating that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 3 of a five-wave pattern forming an ending diagonal. This structure typically marks the final stage of a bullish cycle, just before a major correction.¬† Xanrox predicts that Bitcoin will eventually enter two final wave stages (Wave 4 and 5) before reaching a cycle peak. According to his analysis, the ideal range for this bull run lies between $120,000 and $125,000. More precisely, he highlights a Fibonacci Extension target of 1.618 at $122,069 as the potential top of this bull cycle.¬† The TradingView analyst also notes that this Fibonacci target is the best price to sell and prepare for the bear market that‚Äôs projected to follow. Notably, this price level aligns with a long-term trend line that stretches from Bitcoin‚Äôs 2017 peak to the 2021 top and the next forecasted 2025 ATH.¬† Strengthening the analyst‚Äôs conviction of a potential rally to $122,069, Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price behavior reveals a consistent relationship with the 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA). The analysis highlights that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly bounced off or corrected to this moving average during key turning points in past cycles. This pattern adds further credibility to the bullish outlook.¬† Next Up: 50% Price Crash To $60,000 Despite Xanrox‚Äôs optimistic price projection for 2025, the analyst warns of an impending Bitcoin market crash in 2026. Once the cryptocurrency completes its final bullish wave and tops out, the analyst anticipates a steep correction, potentially dragging the price down to $60,000. This projected 50% drop mirrors past cycle declines, particularly the sharp correction seen in the 2018 and 2022 bear markets.¬† Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $150,000: BTC Is Mirroring Bullish Fractal From 2020 The analyst‚Äôs chart identifies this looming price crash as part of the natural end to Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-year cycle, emphasizing that buying at the projected peak of $122,069 could expose investors to significant downside risk. Instead, Xanrox recommends preparing for this bearish transition by exiting the market within the previously outlined sell zone and waiting for a re-entry opportunity during the expected 2026 dip.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn. A growing chorus of Bitcoin commentators is raising the alarm over the recent boom in publicly traded companies adopting Bitcoin-centric treasury strategies. The debate ignited this week after pseudonymous investor Stack Hodler (@stackhodler) described the trend as a speculative mania disguised in corporate form, writing on X that ‚ÄúBitcoin treasury companies are this cycle‚Äôs shitcoins.‚Äù His argument: these companies are ‚Äúcreating shares out of thin air to sell to people hoping to outperform Bitcoin,‚Äù with little more than exposure to BTC as their core product. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just TradFi shitcoinery,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúAnd many will get rekt.‚Äù Stack Hodler allowed that these companies are currently soaking up speculative liquidity that might otherwise chase illiquid altcoins. ‚ÄúBut the bad news is that many of these businesses will inevitably be forced to dump their stacks one day,‚Äù he added, pointing to the moment when short-term investors realize that holding equity in a Bitcoin proxy may be less efficient than self-custody. ‚ÄúFiat shenanigans with the potential to unwind‚Äù was how he framed the model. In contrast, he celebrated companies that generate real economic value and use their profits to accumulate Bitcoin‚Äîsomething he views as a sustainable force in Bitcoin‚Äôs monetization arc. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next? Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera entered the conversation by referencing MicroStrategy‚Äôs Q1 2025 earnings call, where Michael Saylor laid out the rationale for the company&#8217;s persistent premium to net asset value. ‚ÄúSaylor outlined some reasons for MSTR being at a multiple to NAV,‚Äù Livera said. While acknowledging the cyclical nature of that premium‚Äîcomparing it to the GBTC discount blowout in the previous cycle‚Äîhe argued there‚Äôs a broader structural context. ‚ÄúBitcoin is a $2 trillion asset in a world of $1,000 trillion in assets,‚Äù Livera noted, emphasizing that many large capital allocators remain unable to directly hold Bitcoin due to regulatory, tax, or mandate-related restrictions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a case for some treasury companies to exist long-term, so long as they‚Äôre managed prudently.‚Äù The Bitcoin Treasury Copy-Cat Surge But Stack Hodler wasn‚Äôt referring to MicroStrategy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about the copycats that are popping up at an accelerating pace,‚Äù he responded. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to draft off MSTR‚Äôs success, similar to how shitcoins drafted off of BTC‚Äôs success.‚Äù He said he doesn‚Äôt deny that regulatory arbitrage might support a few of these firms in the short to medium term, but questioned the viability of companies whose primary activity appears to be printing shares and using the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. ‚ÄúI love seeing companies with real profitable businesses stack BTC. Fiat engineering seems shakier to me long-term.‚Äù Scott Melker, host of ‚ÄúThe Wolf of All Streets‚Äù podcast, added to the discussion: ‚ÄúI hate to even think this, because I‚Äôm a huge fan‚Äîbut Bitcoin treasury companies raising debt to buy Bitcoin could be the next bubble.‚Äù Market structure analyst Dave Weisberger agreed that risk is present, but took a more measured stance. ‚ÄúSure. But bubbles have to inflate before we worry about them‚Ä¶ spoiler, Bitcoin is NOT near bubble territory.‚Äù Technical analyst FiboSwanny, a 25-year market veteran, focused on leverage and market structure. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a bubble forming, it‚Äôs likely in the financial instruments and leverage around Bitcoin,‚Äù he said, citing debt-funded treasury purchases, ETFs, and derivatives. ‚ÄúNot in actual Bitcoin itself.‚Äù Lark Davis took a more bearish tone: ‚ÄúThis is our GBTC leverage this cycle that will have a horrific unwind with devastating consequences later. Especially the companies buying altcoins.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci Swan CEO Cory Klippsten didn‚Äôt mince words either. ‚ÄúAlready jumped the shark,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúHave been predicting it for a year, but it‚Äôs inevitable now.‚Äù The current landscape includes dozens of public companies with direct Bitcoin holdings, some of which are drawing intense retail speculation. MicroStrategy remains the dominant force, with well over half a million Bitcoin on its books. Other names include Metaplanet in Japan, Semler Scientific, KULR Technology, and various new entrants who have reoriented their corporate missions entirely around Bitcoin accumulation. Many of these firms are now trading at multi-billion-dollar valuations, far above what their underlying business models would suggest. But the sustainability of the model remains in question. Most of these companies rely on issuing new equity at inflated valuations to finance further Bitcoin purchases, creating a reflexive cycle where rising BTC prices inflate share prices, which in turn enable more buying. That dynamic works beautifully in a bull market but can reverse quickly in a downturn. The debate over how institutional exposure is structured becomes increasingly relevant. Stack Hodler framed it simply: ‚ÄúBitcoin is and always will be the best risk-return asset to hold in this space. Part of successfully holding Bitcoin is being able to resist all the ‚Äòbetter Bitcoins‚Äô that inevitably arise during your journey.‚Äù Whether the new class of treasury companies represents innovation, opportunism, or simply a bubble waiting to burst, remains one of the key questions of this cycle.

Bitcoin Investors With 10 to 10,000 BTC Have Expanded Holdings Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the supply held by Bitcoin&#8217;s key investors: those holding between between 10 and 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1 million at the lower end and $1 billion at the upper end. Thus, the only investors who would be able to qualify for it would be the ones with substantial holdings. Generally, the influence of any entity in the market goes up the more supply that they control, so the holders belonging to this range would hold an important place in the ecosystem. Collectively, these investors are popularly known as the sharks and whales. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm, which shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the sharks and whales, an indicator that tracks the combined supply held by members of these cohorts: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin sharks and whales have seen their Supply Distribution go up recently, which suggests these large investors have been expanding their holdings. More specifically, the investors falling in the 10 to 10,000 BTC range have added around 83,100 tokens to their wallets over the past month. This accumulation hasn&#8217;t come in a constant manner, however, as these investors in fact reduced their supply for a period earlier in the month. This selling from the cohorts followed BTC&#8217;s recovery beyond $97,000, so it&#8217;s likely that the motive behind it was profit-taking. From the chart, it&#8217;s also visible that this selloff resulted in a pullback for the cryptocurrency. During the latest renewal of bullish momentum, the sharks and whales have again resumed their Bitcoin accumulation and have notably surpassed their holdings from the earlier peak. So far, the groups have shown no signs of profit-taking, which can naturally be a bullish sign for the rally&#8217;s sustainability. Related Reading: XRP Target Could Be $15 If This Pattern Is In Play, Analyst Says In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the Supply Distribution of the investors carrying less than 0.1 BTC. Interestingly, these investors have been selling while the sharks and whales have gone through accumulation. This could be an indication that the shrimps believe the top could be in soon. Given the accumulation from the large investors, though, the analytics firm notes, &#8220;it may be a matter of time until Bitcoin&#8217;s coveted $110K all-time high level is breached, particularly after the U.S. &#38; China tariff pause.&#8221; BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,800, up 11% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Buyers Take Control: Indicator That Predicted Previous Bitcoin Rallies Fires Again. Bitcoin has been able to climb above the $104,000 level, following a notable double-digit increase over the past week. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $104,271, narrowing the gap to its all-time high of $109,000. This recent price surge is not occurring in isolation. Instead, it appears closely tied to broader macroeconomic developments, most notably, the recent easing of trade tensions between the US and China, with both countries reducing tariffs on certain imports and exports. Market participants have responded positively to these policy shifts, signaling renewed risk appetite across traditional and digital asset markets. Bitcoin‚Äôs rally over the weekend reflects this optimism, with analysts identifying key technical indicators pointing toward rising buyer strength. One such indicator, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, is gaining attention for marking previous turning points in Bitcoin‚Äôs price history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as $312M BTC Exit Binance Following US-China Trade Deal Bitcoin Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Signals Renewed Bullish Control CryptoQuant contributor G a a h highlighted that the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric measuring the ratio of market buy orders to sell orders, has climbed to a significant threshold of 1.02. Historically, similar levels have coincided with crucial inflection points in Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement. For instance, this metric reached comparable highs during the late 2022 lows between $15,000 and $20,000, and again in October 2023 as Bitcoin broke through the $30,000 resistance level. According to G a a h, this recent breakout above the 1.00 line reflects an increase in aggressive buying activity, with market takers once again asserting short-term control. This suggests upward momentum may persist in the near term. However, the analyst also cautioned that these same conditions have previously been followed by volatility spikes, marking both the start and reversal of market trends. The analyst wrote: It&#8217;s worth noting that in previous periods, this same level has coincided with reversal zones or strong volatility, marking both the start and end of trends. We are therefore facing a scenario where buyer appetite could continue to drive BTC towards new highs. Realized Price Trends Confirm Ongoing Market Strength In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan examined Bitcoin‚Äôs realized price, a metric that reflects the average purchase price of all circulating BTC, as a tool to gauge market sentiment and directional strength. According to the report, the realized price is still on the rise, indicating that investors are increasingly accumulating BTC at higher prices. This trend differs significantly from previous cycles, where a reversal in the realized price preceded steep corrections. Crypto Dan attributes the current rise to institutional inflows, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate balance sheet purchases. These channels have brought in sustained capital, elevating the average acquisition price and reinforcing market structure. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 As institutional players continue to allocate capital into Bitcoin, the realized price trend suggests that the ongoing rally may have more room to extend. With macroeconomic support from tariff reductions and on-chain indicators flashing green, the broader setup remains constructive for Bitcoin‚Äôs continued strength in the near term.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels. Amid its recent breakout, Ethereum (ETH) has recovered a crucial Range lost in Q1, preparing to surge to the mid-zone of this area. However, various analysts forecast potential volatility for the King of Altcoins, as it faces some resistance at the current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance After 10% Weekly Rally ‚Äì Confirmation Or Rejection Next? Ethereum To Trade Sideways Before Next Jump After surging nearly 45% in the past week, Ethereum has reclaimed its $2,200-$3,900 macro range lost in March. During the late-April market pump, the cryptocurrency recovered from its 18-month low of $1,380, jumping toward the $1,800 resistance before breaking out last Thursday. ETH has smashed past the $2,000 resistance and regained the crucial $2,100 and $2,300 levels before retesting the $2,600 resistance over the weekend. Since then, the King of Altcoins has hovered between the $2,400-$2,600 price range, hitting a two-month high of $2,624 on Monday. Market watcher Castillo Trading highlighted that Ethereum is ‚Äúdoing exactly what it should be. Taking some time to build a base at important levels before the next move.‚Äù The analyst stated that the $2,400-$2,700 zone will likely be ETH‚Äôs trading range for the upcoming days after its retest of the range lows as support, with ‚Äúsome shakeouts in both directions before continuing its next leg up.‚Äù Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs current level is important, as it could determine its short-term direction. According to the trader, Ethereum could drop to $2,300 or below the $2,100 support level if it loses the key area. ‚ÄúIn that case, you can simply wait for a consolidation to be formed at those levels,‚Äù he explained. On the contrary, if ETH breaks past the $2,600 resistance, and price keeps surging, the current level may ‚Äúbecome a nice retest of the horizontal.‚Äù Notably, the next crucial horizontal level sits around the $2,850-$2,900 range, a significant support and resistance area amid the Q3 2024 pullback and the Q4 2024 breakout. Is A Dip Or A 15% Shakeout Coming? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Ethereum secured a key Weekly Close after closing the week at $2,514 and officially reclaiming its Macro Range. According to the analyst, history suggests that ETH will ‚Äúlikely lift across the Range‚Äù over time, while ‚Äúany dips, if needed at all, would only solidify $2200 as Range Low support.‚Äù He stressed that the recent Weekly Close occurred at the top of a crucial cluster, enabling a scenario where ‚Äújust a small dip would suffice, if the green circled retest repeats here at ~$2468 (black).‚Äù However, if that level is lost, ETH could see a 10%-15% pullback toward the $2,200-$2,100 mark. Rekt Capital also remarked that the second-largest crypto by market capitalization has managed to fill the $2,530-$2,630 Daily CME Gap, created in March. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 Amid its breakout, ETH also formed two small CME Gaps at the $2,300-$2,400 and $2,100-$2,200 levels, which could be closed soon. The former is the ‚Äúmore important dipping area, as it is also a Weekly CME Gap.‚Äù Additionally, he affirmed that Ethereum intends to fill its Macro CME Gap, between $2,900 and $3,350, signaling that a surge toward those levels could be ahead. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,597, a 5% increase in the daily timeframe.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Open Interest Up Despite Price Pullback, Data Shows. Data shows the Dogecoin Futures Open Interest has continued to rise, a sign that the price pullback hasn&#8217;t discouraged speculative activity. Dogecoin Futures Open Interest Is Up Almost 64% Over Past Week In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Futures Open Interest of Dogecoin. The &#8220;Futures Open Interest&#8221; here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of futures positions related to DOGE that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up more positions on the market. The total leverage present in the sector usually goes up when new positions appear, so this kind of trend can lead to more volatility for the asset&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks &#38; Whales Continue To Accumulate: Stage Set For New All-Time High? On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Usually, the cryptocurrency becomes more stable following such a trend. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Futures Open Interest over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin Futures Open Interest has witnessed a huge increase recently, a sign that investors have put up a large number of bets related to the memecoin. Over the past week, the metric&#8217;s value has gone from $989 million to $1.62 billion, which implies growth of almost 64%. Initially, this strong uplift in speculative activity coincided with DOGE&#8217;s sharp recovery rally. Investors usually find rallies to be exciting, so they tend to open up more positions on the futures market during them. Interestingly, though, despite the fact that the Dogecoin rally has gone cool most recently and the price has even registered some pullback, the Futures Open Interest has only continued to move up. &#8220;This decoupling suggests persistent speculative positioning, even as price momentum fades &#8211; a setup worth monitoring,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? DOGE isn&#8217;t the only asset that has enjoyed a boost in speculative activity recently. As Glassnode has pointed out in another X post, XRP has also seen its Futures Open Interest shoot up. During the same window as Dogecoin&#8217;s Open Interest increase, XRP has observed the indicator go up by 41.6%, from $2.4 billion to $3.4 billion. &#8220;This sharp increase in leverage coincides with a price rally from $2.14 to $2.48, suggesting elevated speculative activity and growing directional conviction,&#8221; says the analytics firm.

Let&rsquo;s find out.</p><h3>Quantum computing and the threat to Bitcoin</h3><p>Bitcoin utilizes the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-encourages-industry-to-use-bitcoins-sha-256-encryption"">SHA-256 hashing algorithm</a>, a National Security Agency (NSA)-developed encryption algorithm. SHA-256 prevents <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/redditors-fear-brute-force-hack-mt-gox-claims-system"">brute force</a> attacks against the Bitcoin network, as decrypting it with current hardware can take decades. However, the emerging threat to SHA-256 is <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-vs-quantum-computing-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-cryptocurrencies"">quantum computing</a>, a method of computing that harnesses quantum physics and is much faster than traditional computing.</p><p>At a fundamental level, quantum computing utilizes quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states. This contradicts binary (traditional) computing, which uses binary bits (1s and 0s). In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor presented an algorithm for quantum computers to solve complex algorithms in seconds, rather than the decades it can take for conventional hardware. At the time, no hardware could effectively run it, but <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/googles-willow-quantum-chip-vs-bitcoin-security-whats-at-stake"">recent advances like Google Willow</a> are nearing that capability.</p><p>Quantum computing, when paired with Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, can disrupt Bitcoin cryptographic systems as we know them. Shor&rsquo;s algorithm allows quantum computers to solve complex math super fast, potentially threatening Bitcoin&rsquo;s safety.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>If quantum tech gets strong enough, Bitcoin&rsquo;s current security could become obsolete, so developers are racing to create &ldquo;quantum-proof&rdquo; shields using new math that even Shor&rsquo;s algorithm can&rsquo;t break.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-191206-2"">            <h2>                Quantum threat to Bitcoin: How real is the danger?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum computing, but how serious is the risk?</em></p><p>When you create a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-wallets-explained"">crypto wallet</a>, it generates two important things: a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/public-key-vs-private-key"">private key and a public key</a>. The private key is a secret code, like a password, that you must keep safe. The public key is created from your private key, and your wallet address (like a bank account number) is made from the public key.</p><p>You share your wallet address with others so they can send you cryptocurrency, just like you share your email address for someone to contact you. However, you never share your private key. It&rsquo;s like the password to your email &mdash; only you need it to access and spend the money in your wallet.</p><p>Your <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/private-keys-vs-seed-phrases"">private key</a> is like a master password that controls your crypto wallet. From this private key, your wallet can create many public keys, and each public key generates a wallet address.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you use a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-a-crypto-hardware-wallet"">hardware wallet</a>, it has one private key but can create unlimited public keys (wallet addresses). This means you can have different addresses for each cryptocurrency supported by the wallet or even multiple addresses for the same cryptocurrency, all managed by a single private key.</p><p>While generating a public key from a private key is straightforward, figuring out a private key from a public key is extremely hard &mdash; almost impossible &mdash; which keeps your wallet secure. Every time you send cryptocurrency, your private key creates a special code called a signature. This signature proves you own the funds and want to send them. The system that uses your private key, public key and signature to secure transactions is called the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).</p><p>It is believed that quantum computing could reverse the process and generate private keys out of public ones. It is feared that this could cause many Bitcoin holders (especially whales and <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-wallet-moves-15-years-dormant-satoshi-nakamoto"">Satoshi-era wallets</a>) to lose their funds.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin address types and quantum risks</h3><p>When you send Bitcoin, you use a specific address type to direct the payment. Each address type has unique features, affecting security, privacy and vulnerability to quantum computing attacks like Shor&rsquo;s algorithm.</p><h3>P2PK address types</h3><p>When you pay someone with Bitcoin, the transaction is typically considered a &ldquo;pay-to-public-key&rdquo; (P2PK). This was the most common payment method in 2009, according to a <a href=""https://www.deloitte.com/nl/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">report</a> from consulting firm Deloitte.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the original Bitcoin released at the network&rsquo;s launch is held in wallets with the P2PK address type, primarily due to the fact that they&rsquo;ve sent transactions since Bitcoin&rsquo;s 2009 launch. These addresses are long (up to 130 characters), making them less user-friendly.</p><p>Wallets with the P2PK address type are most susceptible to Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, as it can brute force the private key from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-bitcoin-lost-wallet-threat-tether-ceo"">P2PK wallet address</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>P2PKH address types</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a second address type that&rsquo;s more resistant to Shor&rsquo;s algorithm: the pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH). P2PKH addresses are shorter and are generated from the hash (a unique, hexadecimal value) of a public key created using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms instead of displaying the full key itself.</p><p>These addresses are shorter (33-34 characters), start with &ldquo;1,&rdquo; and are encoded in Base58 format. Such addresses are widely used and include a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/ethereum-address-checksum-explained"">checksum to prevent typos</a>, making them more reliable.</p><p>P2PKH addresses are more resistant to Shor&rsquo;s algorithm than P2PK because the public key is hashed. The public key is only revealed when you spend from the address (not when receiving). If a P2PKH address never sends Bitcoin, its public key stays hidden, offering better protection against quantum attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>However, reusing a P2PKH address (sending from it multiple times) exposes the public key, increasing vulnerability. Also, when you spend from a P2PKH address, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, making transactions trackable.</p><p><img alt=""The number of wallets with a p2pk address continues to increase"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/b46f2779c62d4a3625e6b0ccd18986da.png"" title=""The number of wallets with a p2pk address continues to increase"" /></p><h3>Taproot addresses</h3><p><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-the-bitcoin-taproot-upgrade"">Taproot is the newest address type</a>, introduced in November 2021 via the Taproot soft fork. It uses Schnorr signatures instead of the ECDSA signatures used by P2PK and P2PKH. These addresses start with &ldquo;bc1p,&rdquo; use Bech32m encoding, and are 62 characters long.</p><p>They offer better privacy. Multisignature (multisig) transactions look like single-signature ones, hiding complex spending conditions. However, Taproot addresses expose the public key (or a tweaked version), making them vulnerable to Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, similar to P2PK.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Willow&rdquo; <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">computer chip</a> is capable of solving a complex problem in just five minutes.

This would threaten Bitcoin and other systems using SHA-256 or ECDSA (the algorithms securing Bitcoin transactions). However, this threat is not imminent, and solutions are already in progress.</p><p>While some believe that Project 11 presented the Q-Day Prize to take down Bitcoin, the company claims this initiative is aimed at &ldquo;quantum-proofing&rdquo; the network.</p><p>In July 2022, the US Department of Commerce&rsquo;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href=""https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> four quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms resulting from a six-year challenge to develop such solutions.</p><p><img alt=""NIST is pushing encryption technology forward"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/7053ffb6167bdf95180c759442cf660c.jpg"" title=""NIST is pushing encryption technology forward"" /></p><p>Quantum computing won&rsquo;t develop in isolation, and centralized systems like government and financial networks could be bigger targets than Bitcoin&rsquo;s decentralized blockchain. These systems use outdated cryptography, like RSA, vulnerable to Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, and store sensitive data (e.g., banking records). Their single points of failure make breaches easier than attacking Bitcoin&rsquo;s distributed nodes.&nbsp;</p><p>The International Monetary Fund <a href=""https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2021/09/quantum-computings-possibilitiesand-perils-deodoro"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">warns</a> quantum computers could disrupt mobile banking, while Dr. Michele Mosca from the Institute for Quantum Computing <a href=""https://postquantum.com/post-quantum/practical-steps-quantum/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">highlights</a> &ldquo;harvest-now, decrypt-later&rdquo; risks for centralized data (where attackers store encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers).

These quantum computing blockchain security methods present a few different approaches.</em></p>                    </div><div id=""explained-block-191206-0"">            <h2>                How to increase your security against quantum threats            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>While the quantum computing cryptocurrency risk is less of a threat than one might think, it&rsquo;s still best to stay prepared.</em></p><p>Still, if you&rsquo;re worried about <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-threat-crypto-portfolio"">Bitcoin quantum vulnerability</a>, there are a few precautions you can take to secure your crypto finances.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid reusing public addresses: </strong>Most crypto wallets allow you to generate a new public address for every transaction. This practice will make it much harder to track your spending habits.</li><li><strong>Move funds to a private wallet:</strong> If you&rsquo;ve been using the same public wallet address for some time, consider moving your funds to a new wallet with no history. This will help keep your spending habits private.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use a different blockchain network: </strong>Legacy networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered less quantum resistant than newer networks with more modern security algorithms. Consider alternative networks with quantum resistance in mind.</li><li><strong>Stay informed: </strong>Pay attention to the results of the Q-Day Prize challenge, and stay up to date with quantum computing news so you can react accordingly. The best defense is an informed one.</li></ul><p>While quantum risk is not immediate, developers and cybersecurity experts are actively working on solutions to ensure long-term security. In the meantime, users should stay updated about Bitcoin protocol updates and best practices, such as avoiding address reuse, as the network gradually moves toward quantum resistance.</p>                    </div></div>

News,Solana,"Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance. Just like the rest of the market, the Solana price had previously hit a roadblock as resistance mounted. This stopped its recovery dead in its tracks before hitting the $180 level, and triggering a downward spiral. However, a crypto analyst has cautioned investors against panicking during this time, explaining that this is the time to be patient. Wait For More Defined Trends In a TradingView post, crypto analyst SiDec explained the current situation surrounding the Solana price, warning investors to not be in a hurry to enter into the coin. They points out that at this level, where the Solana price has hit resistance, it presents a lot of risk for those rushing to get into the market. Related Reading: Why The US-China 90-Day Tariff Slash Can Push Bitcoin Price Above $110,000 As explained, $175-$183 are historical resistance zones for the altcoin, so it is no surprise that investors are choosing these levels to exit after the recent market dump. Additionally, smart money is also looking for liquidity at these levels, and the Solana price is prone to false breakouts due to this development. When it comes to trading Solana, the crypto analyst explains that investors must wait for one of two things to happen. Either there is a pullback in the Solana price and it falls toward a ‚Äúconfluence-rich support zone‚Äù or wait for a clean breakout above the resistance at $183, as well as a retest and confirmation. With the current trend, the analyst identified the two key zones for the Solana price now. The first lies at $179.85, which was recently tested, and then $180.52, which is yet to be tested. The latter, at $180.52, holds the key as a break above this level would be the confirmation needed for a strong bullish continuation. Solana Price Completes Elliot Wave Count Another interesting development for the Solana price that the crypto analyst points out is the fact that the altcoin has completed a 5-wave sequence. The Elliot Wave Theory comes in only five waves and with the completion, it could mean that the bull rally is over for the Solana price. The next thing that could happen from here is that the price continues to correct, before confirmation leads to a bullish continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends The formation of the Fib Speed Fan pattern, as pointed out by the analyst, also suggests that the price could correct further from here. ‚ÄúThe 0.618 Fib Speed Fan ‚Äî drawn from the all-time high at $295.83 to the swing low at $95.26 ‚Äî aligns perfectly with this resistance zone, adding more weight to the idea of a potential rejection or pause,‚Äù the analyst wrote. Given these developments, the crypto analyst has preferred possible entry points for long ad short positions. For bulls going long, the $165.42-$164.25 level could offer opportunity. While for short traders, the best setup shows a reversal play and entry at $200. Featured image from Dall.E, Chart from TradingView.com",0.1,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-14T08:45:17.543025+00:00,

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) has delivered a strongly bullish outlook for Dogecoin in his latest video update, describing the meme-turned-macro asset‚Äôs current structure as one of the most compelling setups across the entire altcoin market. ‚ÄúDogecoin has one of the nicest charts, if not the nicest altcoin chart in all of altcoins,‚Äù Kevin said. ‚ÄúNext to XRP and ETH, Dogecoin got a beautiful chart.‚Äù Dogecoin‚Äôs Pattern Mirrors Last Bull Run In a wide-ranging technical review covering Bitcoin, Ethereum, and macro trends, Kevin dedicated a significant section of his analysis to Dogecoin, highlighting an emerging pattern of higher lows, clean breakouts, and bullish divergences that mirror previous accumulation phases. According to him, Dogecoin is displaying what he called ‚Äúperfect price structure‚Äù‚Äîa rare quality among altcoins. ‚ÄúYou get this bottom, you get the double bottom, you get the bullish divergence. Bang,‚Äù he said while showcasing recent price action and comparing it to prior cycles. ‚ÄúThen again‚Äîyou get the bottom, the double bottom, the bullish divergence. Bang. This is literally the same thing all over again.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching Kevin‚Äôs view is built on strong historical confluence and Fibonacci retracement zones. He noted that Dogecoin&#8217;s last major bull cycle saw the token top out at precisely the 1.618 to 1.703 Fibonacci extension range. By replicating the same fib structure from the most recent bottom, Kevin identified a similar target range between $1.10 and $1.25, calling it a ‚Äúreal deal price target‚Äù rather than clickbait. ‚ÄúCould $1.10 to $1.25 be the next target for Doge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI think if we can replicate a move like we did back in November‚Äîwhich we can, and if anything, we can do way better‚Äîthen absolutely. That‚Äôs the zone I‚Äôm watching.‚Äù He further emphasized that the golden pocket and the 1.703 fib extension mark a crucial resistance area, just as they did in Dogecoin‚Äôs previous cycle. ‚ÄúRemember this,‚Äù Kevin said. ‚ÄúYou run your fib‚Äîboom‚ÄîDogecoin tops out right at the golden pocket and the 1.703 fib. We‚Äôre seeing the same thing lineup here.‚Äù Zooming out, Kevin placed Dogecoin‚Äôs strength in the broader context of a shifting crypto macro environment. Bitcoin dominance, he noted, is dropping sharply from the macro 0.786 Fibonacci level‚Äîa move that typically allows altcoins like Dogecoin to catch a stronger bid. ‚ÄúWe are seeing exactly what we said would happen. That is: altcoins catching a bid. A really nice bid,‚Äù he remarked. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup The bullish sentiment extends beyond Dogecoin. Kevin noted that macroeconomic data is supportive, with declining inflation, rising GDP, strong labor markets, and easing tariff fears contributing to renewed confidence across financial markets. ‚ÄúEverything seems to be lining up at the exact right time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the macro on our side, we‚Äôve got the technicals on our side, and now even Dogecoin is flashing green.‚Äù Still, he added a caveat of caution. ‚ÄúIn the short term, just be a little cautious until we break the resistance we need to break,‚Äù Kevin said, referencing the broader crypto market‚Äôs proximity to key Fibonacci and moving average thresholds. ‚ÄúTreat resistance as resistance‚Äîuntil it‚Äôs not.‚Äù Nonetheless, Kevin concluded that Dogecoin‚Äôs current setup is as strong as it‚Äôs been in years. ‚ÄúThis is just perfect, perfect price structure,‚Äù he reiterated. ‚ÄúWhen the market gets going, I think this thing&#8217;s going to perform massively.‚Äù His final message: if history rhymes, Dogecoin could be poised for a powerful move to surpass the psychological $1 mark. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.242. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-14T10:45:16.948401+00:00,

News,Bitcoin,"Next Crypto to 1,000x as Bitcoin Targets $135K by June and Trump Predicts Market Explosion. Bitcoin has protected the $100K mark and is consolidating above the all-important price level. There are several factors that have contributed to Bitcoin&#8217;s recent run. For starters, the CBOE Volatility Index is now down to just under 20. Also known as the fear index, the CBOE measures the expected volatility in markets for the next 30 days. A lower VIX shows less expected volatility and signs of stability. Earlier in the year, the VIX stood at just under 60, representing high uncertainty. However, it‚Äôs now come down to a 30-year average of just 20. The recent de-escalation in the ongoing US-China tariff war has also played a major role in strengthening Bitcoin above $100K. The US has agreed to tariffs of 30%, whereas China will now only impose a 10% tariff on US goods. This has led to ‚Äòrisk on‚Äô sentiment when it comes to Bitcoin investors. Keep reading as we dig into various technical reasons that point towards an even greener crypto market in the coming weeks. We&#8217;ll also recommend three tokens that could be the next crypto to 1,000x if the market remains this bullish. Bitcoin ‚ÄòRisk-On‚Äô Sentiments The US CPI inflation rate has also dropped to 2.3% YOY in April 2025, down 0.1% compared to March. This is the lowest it has been since February 2021. Slowing inflation indicates stable economic conditions, supporting the ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô environment for Bitcoin. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the Bitcoin Bull Score Index has increased from 20 to 80. While a score of 22-50 indicates neutral to slightly bullish conditions, a score above 80 indicates that Bitcoin is extremely bullish with strong rallies. Historically, whenever the Bull Score Index has hit 80, it has been followed by strong market rallies. What&#8217;s more, the Bitcoin fear-greed index is also moving up. It now stands at 53.3%. Although you could argue that this is slightly higher, it&#8217;s still quite far from the overload zone at 80%. All these positive market sentiments suggest that Bitcoin may soon break its all-time high and head towards the highly anticipated $135K level. Trump&#8217;s Promise Confirms Bullish Bias Speaking at the Saudi-US investment forum, Trump said that the markets are going to go a lot higher from here. He said that a lot of investment is happening, and jobs are being created at a pace never seen before. This will propel the equity markets to a new high. The magic may also pass on to Bitcoin, which has become a ‚Äòsafe-haven‚Äô investment for corporations. Speaking of $BTC-loving corporations, Strategy has stashed over 550K $BTC so far. Semler Scientific has also purchased 1,510 $BTC since the beginning of 2025, taking its total holdings to 3,808 $BTC. Similarly, Twenty One Capital, an investment vehicle backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, now holds a total of 36,312 $BTC. This is after Tether recently bought $458.7M worth of $BTC for the firm. We continue to accretively grow our Bitcoin arsenal using operating cash flow and proceeds from debt and equity financings. ‚Äì Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific As is pretty evident, there is an increasing push by corporations to convert part of their cash reserves into Bitcoin. With strong technical indicators and market confidence, Bitcoin looks well poised to reach $135K. If you don‚Äôt want to miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime bull run, here are a few cryptos worth investing in. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Themed Altcoin to Buy Right Now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is undoubtedly one of the frontrunners to become the next big crypto coin, thanks to its unique way of rooting for Bitcoin. It&#8217;s, in fact, the ONLY crypto today offering free (and 100% real) $BTC in its airdrops to its token holders. This is huge not only because $BTC is essentially worth $100K+ but also because it&#8217;s flipping the script on how crypto projects have typically gone about their airdrops, i.e., by offering more of their own tokens for free. BTC Bull Token&#8217;s Bitcoin airdrops will occur each time the king cryptocurrency breaches a new landmark figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. To take part, you need to hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. More good news for $BTCBULL investors: the project will follow a deflationary model. Under this, a handful of $BTCBULL tokens will be erased from the total supply at regular intervals. As supply shrinks and $BTC marches on, we can expect $BTCBULL to absolutely explode. It&#8217;s worth noting that according to our BTC Bull Token price prediction, this new crypto could easily reach $0.096 by 2026. Looking to buy $BTCBULL? Each token costs just $0.00251, and the project has already raised over $5.7M. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) ‚Äì Revolutionary New Crypto Changing the Online Creator Industry SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) sets itself apart by being the first-ever crypto subscription platform to integrate AI. It&#8217;s a beacon of hope for the $85B digital content industry that has been struggling with high commissions, little to no automation, and dying creator-fan relationships. Creators on SUBBD will have a slew of AI tools, such as voice, image, and video generators, to upscale and automate the entire process of creating and distributing content. In addition to benefiting from lower platform fees, they&#8217;ll also have the liberty to set up various payment models for their content. These include pay-per-view, subscriptions, tipping, and NFT sales. As for the fans, they&#8217;ll be able to use $SUBBD, the platform&#8217;s native token, to pay for all the exclusive content available on SUBBD. In addition to access to premium AI content, $SUBBD token holders will also get discounts on subscriptions and content, early-bird access to new features, and voting rights. Combined with a staking program that gives token holders access to exclusive creator livestreams, daily BTS drops, and a fixed APY of 20%, it&#8217;s not a surprise that our $SUBBD price prediction found the token could jump 1,200% by 2026. Buy the $SUBBD presale token today for just $0.0554 each. The project has so far raised over $390K in early investor funding. 3. Just a chill guy ($CHILLGUY) ‚Äì Amusing Meme Coin on a Roll Right Now What do you call a person who diligently hustles as a taxi driver in GTA V? Stupid? Depressed? Nah; we&#8217;d say they&#8217;re &#8216;Just a chill guy.&#8217; The GTA V example perfectly explains what this extraordinarily viral meme stands for ‚Äì a &#8216;lowkey,&#8217; &#8216;whatever&#8217; attitude that doesn&#8217;t care about what anyone thinks. The meme character is quite dashing, too. He dons blue jeans, red shoes, and a grey sweater, all of which, by the way, pale in comparison to the coolness with which he keeps his hands in his pockets and boasts a smirk on his face. Needless to say, this is exactly the kind of meme crypto degens love to back. As a result, there&#8217;s nothing &#8216;chill&#8217; about $CHILLGUY&#8217;s performance. The token is up over 130% in the last seven days and a brain-melting 460% in the last month or so. Plus, given that it&#8217;s still available for just $0.1140, Just a chill guy is easily one of the best cryptos to buy now. The Next Crypto to 1,000X ‚Äì A Real Possibility or a Pipe Dream? There&#8217;s no refuting that top altcoins like $BTCBULL and $SUBBD have the potential to generate massive gains. However, they, like much of the altcoin space, depend on the broader crypto market&#8217;s pace and direction. Even though things, as they stand now, look bright, really bad news could send prices crashing any minute. So, despite the bullishness, we suggest that you only invest an amount you&#8217;re comfortable losing.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details. Ethereum is trading firmly above the $2,600 mark after a surge in buying pressure over the past several days, marking a strong shift in momentum across the broader market. After months of choppy action and bearish sentiment, bulls are clearly back in control. ETH has reclaimed several key levels with conviction, signaling a potential continuation toward higher targets. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Price action now looks structurally bullish, with Ethereum pushing through resistance zones that previously capped upside for weeks. This rally has reignited investor confidence and brought renewed attention to Ethereum‚Äôs medium-term outlook, especially as altcoins start to show strength alongside Bitcoin‚Äôs recent consolidation. According to fresh data from Glassnode, the next major resistance area to watch is at $3,100, where Ethereum is likely to encounter heavier sell pressure.¬†This level, derived from pricing bands, now defines Ethereum‚Äôs current trading range and will likely dictate price direction in the coming sessions.¬†With volatility returning and sentiment improving, Ethereum appears poised for a¬†critical breakout or a decisive retest of support, depending on how bulls handle the next leg. Ethereum Nears Key Resistance As Altseason Expectations Grow Ethereum has rallied over 98% since its April 9th low, marking one of its most powerful recoveries in recent years. This explosive move has not only flipped sentiment from bearish to bullish, but also reignited speculation around a broader altseason ‚Äî a period in which altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. After months of heavy selling pressure that began in late December, Ethereum is now showing sustained strength for the first time. The price has reclaimed critical levels, and momentum continues to build as traders and investors rotate capital back into ETH and other large-cap altcoins. Market participants are watching closely to see if Ethereum can maintain this pace and confirm a longer-term trend reversal. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared Ethereum‚Äôs MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, offering a clear technical framework for what‚Äôs next. According to the data, the next key resistance level is at $3,100 ‚Äî a region that could act as a short-term ceiling if buying pressure fades. On the downside, the major support zone sits at $2,233, a critical level to hold in the event of a pullback. As Ethereum continues to climb, these levels will become increasingly important. A clean breakout above $3,100 could open the door to a broader rally across altcoins, while a rejection or correction would likely test the market‚Äôs true conviction. For now, ETH remains in a bullish structure, supported by growing volume, on-chain signals, and renewed investor enthusiasm. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum leads the charge into a full-fledged altseason. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst ETH Price Action: Testing Resistance After Massive Rally Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,604, consolidating after a sharp surge that lifted it from under $1,400 to a high of $2,725 in just two weeks. The daily chart shows that ETH is now approaching the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702.60, which is acting as a key resistance level. This zone also coincides with recent local highs from early February, making it a critical area to break for further upside continuation. The recent rally brought strong volume and bullish momentum, with ETH closing multiple daily candles above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,435.66. This is a positive sign for trend reversal after months of sustained bearish pressure. However, today‚Äôs pullback signals that bulls are losing some steam as the price tests this crucial resistance. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support If ETH can consolidate above the $2,500‚Äì$2,600 range and break through the 200-day SMA with convincing volume, the next upside target lies near the $3,100 level, as noted in recent technical studies. On the downside, maintaining support above $2,435‚Äì$2,450 is essential to avoid a deeper correction. The coming days will reveal whether Ethereum can turn this consolidation into a true breakout or if further cooling is needed before the next leg up.

News,Dogecoin,"Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion. Dogecoin traders are showing a lot of interest in futures contracts, even though the coin‚Äôs price has dipped a bit. That split between price moves and betting activity is drawing attention. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Futures Interest Climbs Despite Pullback According to on‚Äëchain data provider Glassnode, open interest in Dogecoin futures jumped from almost $990‚ÄØmillion to $1.62‚ÄØbillion this week. That rise came after the price slid back from near $0.25 into the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone. It‚Äôs a sign that traders are still placing big bets, even as momentum cools. Back in mid‚ÄëFebruary, open interest fell below $900‚ÄØmillion by April, as Dogecoin headed down from its brief rally above $0.23. This week‚Äôs surge breaks that past trend. Despite $DOGE pulling back from its recent high, Futures Open Interest continues to rise, up +63.9% over the past week ($989M ‚Üí $1.62B). This decoupling suggests persistent speculative positioning, even as price momentum fades &#8211; a setup worth monitoring: https://t.co/N343pGpptL pic.twitter.com/icOVcqDffA ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) May 13, 2025 Price Rally And Minor Setback Based on reports, Dogecoin climbed from roughly $0.16 on May 6 to just over $0.24 by May 11. That‚Äôs a sharp gain in just a few days. Then the price eased back into the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 range. Traders saw higher highs and higher lows overall. They‚Äôve held onto the belief that the upward trend is still intact. Bullish Funding Rate Signals Funding rates have stayed in positive territory, which shows futures traders are mostly long. Data from Coinglass on May 13, 2025, puts rates at 0.0100% on BitMEX, HTX, Gate.io and Bitget. Binance and OKX are a bit lower, at 0.0036% and 0.0034%. Those numbers mean long holders pay short sellers a small fee. That setup can boost a rally. But if the price drops, it can turn costly for those same traders. Support Level Under Watch Market analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Dogecoin closed above its old pre‚Äëhalving resistance on the weekly chart. That level now sits near $0.22 and is acting as support. If DOGE holds that spot, the coin might head toward at least $0.27 next. A failure to stay above $0.22 could shake out some of the most stretched positions. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Overall, the mix of rising futures activity and a soft pullback makes for a tense scene. On one hand, there‚Äôs still a strong bullish bias. On the other, too much one‚Äësided positioning can invite a shakeout. Traders will be watching weekly closes around $0.22 to see if support holds. If it does, a run at $0.27 could happen. If it doesn‚Äôt, shorts may gain the upper hand and push prices lower. Either way, volatility is likely to stay high as Dogecoin‚Äôs roller‚Äëcoaster ride continues.

News,Ethereum,"$1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal. Ethereum is gaining momentum again after tagging the $2,739 level and setting a new local high, reaching prices not seen since late February. The rally marks a strong comeback for ETH, which has been under significant pressure earlier this year. Now, bulls appear firmly in control as the broader crypto market wakes up and capital flows return to altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst Analysts are calling for a potential altseason, fueled by Ethereum&#8217;s relative strength against Bitcoin and growing investor confidence. As Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs, Ethereum has taken the opportunity to outperform, pushing up through key resistance levels with conviction. Supporting this narrative, data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) reveals that $1.2 billion worth of ETH has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges over the past seven days. This sustained trend of net outflows suggests continued accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure, both strong signals for long-term bullish momentum. With price action heating up and investor sentiment shifting, Ethereum could be preparing for a major breakout. If bulls maintain control, the $3,000‚Äì$3,100 region may be tested in the coming days as the next major resistance zone. All eyes are now on ETH as the altcoin market shows signs of life. Ethereum Builds Momentum As Exchange Outflows Signal Accumulation Ethereum is trading above critical levels as speculation of a sustained rally continues to grow. After weeks of sluggish movement, ETH has roared back to life, gaining over 50% in value since last week. This sharp move to the upside has reignited hopes for an altseason, with many analysts viewing Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as the potential trigger for broader altcoin market strength. Ethereum is now holding firmly above the $2,600 mark, a level that had acted as strong resistance for months. This breakout, coupled with increasing momentum against Bitcoin, suggests bulls are regaining control. Traders are closely watching the next major resistance zone between $2,900 and $3,100, which could serve as a key test for Ethereum‚Äôs uptrend. Adding to the bullish case, data from Sentora reveals that $1.2 billion worth of ETH has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges over the past 7 days. This trend has intensified since early May, pointing to increased investor accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. Large exchange outflows are often seen as a sign that holders intend to store ETH off-exchange, decreasing immediate supply and supporting upward price movement. With market sentiment turning bullish and Ethereum leading the charge, all eyes are now on whether ETH can maintain its momentum and drive the altcoin market into a new growth phase. If accumulation trends persist and bulls hold key levels, Ethereum‚Äôs path toward $3,100 could open the door to a broader market rally. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Price Action Details: ETH Testing Key Levels Ethereum‚Äôs weekly chart shows a powerful breakout after weeks of bearish pressure, with ETH now trading around $2,599.14. The recent surge pushed the price above both the 200-week EMA ($2,259.65) and the 200-week SMA ($2,451.55), two critical long-term trend indicators. Reclaiming these levels signals renewed bullish momentum and a strong shift in sentiment. The breakout candle itself is one of the largest weekly green candles in over a year, reflecting a sharp influx of buyer interest and potentially marking a key reversal point after months of downside. Notably, this move brings ETH to levels not seen since February, with the local high for the week reaching $2,739.05. Volume has increased significantly during this move, confirming the strength behind the rally. However, Ethereum now faces overhead resistance near $2,800‚Äì$2,900, a zone that previously acted as support during early 2024 before the breakdown. If bulls maintain momentum and close this week above $2,600, it could open the door for a test of the $3,100 resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next? On the downside, the key support to watch is around $2,450, aligned with the 200-week SMA. A failure to hold that level could invite a retest of $2,250. For now, the trend is bullish, but follow-through next week will be crucial.

News,Solana,"Solana Flips Bullish: Price Climbs Above Ichimoku Cloud With Strong Momentum. Solana (SOL) has officially broken above the Ichimoku Cloud on the daily chart, a key technical signal that often marks the beginning of a bullish trend reversal. After weeks of sideways movement and uncertainty, this decisive breakout suggests that momentum is finally shifting in favor of the bulls. While confirmation from volume and follow-through price action is still needed, the technical outlook is becoming increasingly optimistic. Solana Ichimoku Breakout And Momentum Check Solana&#8217;s breakout above the Ichimoku Cloud is more than just a technical checkpoint; it marks a critical shift in its market structure and trader sentiment. This breakout represents a move from uncertainty to confidence, as buyers begin to gain the upper hand after a period of consolidation and hesitation. Related Reading: Solana At A Crossroads: Consolidation Before The Next Major Surge? So far, momentum indicators are leaning bullish, providing early signs that Solana may be entering a new upward phase. One of the most notable signals comes from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which has recently made a positive crossover. Not only has the MACD line crossed above the signal line, but the two lines have now moved above the zero line. This double confirmation strengthens the signal significantly. When the MACD and signal lines rise above zero, it typically marks the transition from bearish to bullish territory, indicating that momentum is not just shifting but accelerating in favor of the bulls. However, a clear uptick in volume is essential for SOL to sustain and build on this breakout. Volume is what turns a breakout into a trend, and without it, upward momentum can quickly stall. If volume starts to pick up alongside continued price strength, it could ignite the next leg up, potentially pushing Solana toward key resistance levels. Key Levels To Watch Now As Solana begins to show signs of a bullish reversal, identifying and monitoring key price levels becomes essential for both short-term and long-term investors. These levels act as decision points where price action is likely to react, facing resistance or finding support. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst On the upside, it can be observed that the immediate resistance of $164 has been cleared, with SOL now attempting a move toward the $211 resistance level. A clean breakout above this area, especially backed by strong volume, would open the door for a rally toward the $240 mark. Beyond that, $260 remains a major resistance to watch, marking a key round number and prior rejection area. On the downside, $164 now serves as the nearest support following the recent breakout above the Ichimoku Cloud. Holding above this level is crucial to maintain the current bullish structure. A breakdown below it could drag Solana back to the $148‚Äì$118 support range, where buyers previously stepped in.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Up Despite Price Pullback, Data Shows Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the latest URPD data for Dogecoin: As displayed in the above graph, there are no levels immediately nearby to the current Dogecoin price that hold the break-even mark of a significant portion of the supply. The closest level that stands out in the URPD is around $0.21, which hosts the acquisition point of 7.5% of the DOGE supply. For the up direction, there aren&#8217;t any notable cost basis centers until all the way to $0.36, where investors last bought about 3.8% of all tokens in existence. Now, what&#8217;s the relevance of these levels to Dogecoin? To know the answer to that question, investor psychology needs to be understood first. To any holder, their cost basis is naturally an important level, so they can be prone to showing some kind of reaction when a retest of it happens. Whatever this reaction be, it&#8217;s not of significant to the cryptocurrency if only a few investors are showing it. For retests of levels that host the cost basis of a large amount of holders, however, the story can be different. The aforementioned levels could be important ones from this perspective. Generally, investors tend to react by buying if the retest is happening from above, granted the mood in the market is bullish. This is because these holders, who were in profit prior to the retest, might look at the price decline as just a &#8216;dip.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks &#38; Whales Continue To Accumulate: Stage Set For New All-Time High? On the other hand, the holders who were in loss before the retest may decide to sell their Dogecoin, as they could fear that this might be their last opportunity to exit at their break-even for a while. As such, major supply walls below the DOGE spot price can act as potential support zones, while those above it may prove to be resistance areas. Given that the closest two such levels are at $0.21 and $0.36 for the asset right now, they may be where the coin could be the most probable to encounter strong support and resistance, respectively. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.237, up more than 37% in the last seven days.

News,Solana,"Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold. Solana‚Äôs native token is extending an impressive May run that has already carried the market-cap leader among non-EVM smart-contract platforms from $146 at the end of April to as high as $18‚Äù in Wednesday trading, the highest daily close recorded since mid-February. Against that backdrop, independent analyst More Crypto Online (MCO) released a fresh video update outlining why the move is technically ‚Äúvery full but not necessarily overextended or overstretched.‚Äù In the clip, MCO reiterates that the advance from the 30 April swing low traces out ‚Äúa five-wave pattern‚Äù and stresses that, because ‚Äúthere was no confirmed top, one more high was still likely especially as long as this micro-support area held.‚Äù The micro zone he referenced earlier in the week lay between $159.67 and $168.23, a range Solana tested briefly before powering higher. Solana Could Surge To $360 Zooming in, the channel‚Äôs Elliott-wave count now shows five clean waves even on what MCO calls ‚Äúthe nano level,‚Äù a configuration that, in classical wave theory, typically finishes either an impulsive first wave or the terminating leg of a diagonal. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a five-wave move, it can be a so-called A-wave,‚Äù the analyst explains, which would ‚Äúresult in a B-wave, ideally a higher low, and then a C-wave up.‚Äù The alternative‚Äîand MCO‚Äôs preferred scenario‚Äîtreats the structure as wave 1 of a much larger impulse that could ultimately ‚Äúeasily get to $360 or higher.‚Äù Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Grows As 11M Wallets Now Hold 0.1 SOL Or More ‚Äì Analyst For traders trying to calibrate risk in the near term, MCO isolates two numbers that matter most. On the upside he names $191.25 as ‚Äúthe next upside level to watch,‚Äù describing it as the 61.8 percent extension of waves 1 and 3‚Äîa textbook Fibonacci target for a fifth wave. On the downside he warns that ‚Äúit takes a break below $172, which is the last swing low, to indicate that a price top has formed in wave 1.‚Äù In a follow-up post on X he put it even more succinctly: ‚Äú5th wave to the upside is confirmed. $191.25 is the next upside level to watch ‚Ä¶ it takes a break below $172 ‚Ä¶ to indicate that a price top has formed.‚Äù Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move A clean, high-volume break of $191.25 would confirm that the immediate corrective risk has been deferred; a decisive daily close beneath $172 would instead signal that the first leg of the new advance has exhausted itself and that a retracement toward the upper-$160s or even the mid-$150s is underway. As ever, traders should remember that Elliott-wave projections are probabilistic rather than predictive. With volatility historically elevated in Solana, position sizing‚Äîalongside a clear plan for the two technical levels singled out in today‚Äôs analysis‚Äîremains the first line of defence.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon?. Retail participation in the Bitcoin (BTC) market is on the rise, as on-chain data indicates that smaller investors are gradually re-entering the space. This renewed activity is often a sign of growing confidence in the asset and can act as a catalyst for the next leg up in price. Bitcoin Witnesses Rise In Retail Participation According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by on-chain analyst Carmelo Aleman, retail investors &#8211; defined as wallets holding less than $10,000 worth of BTC &#8211; are steadily returning to the market. These participants are typically the most reactive to market movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cycle Indicator Hints At Bullish Breakout Ahead, Analyst Says Aleman noted that while retail investors may not always time the market as effectively as institutional players, their behavior remains a key barometer of broader market sentiment. As more retail investors join, they tend to create a positive feedback loop, reinforcing bullish narratives and driving increased buying pressure, which can attract even more participants. The BTC: Retail Investor 30-Day Change indicator reflects this trend. Since turning positive on April 28, the indicator has shown a 3.4% increase in retail buying through May 13, signalling a strong resurgence in small-investor activity. Aleman added that if Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum, the broader crypto market could benefit, as retail investors may begin diversifying into other assets in search of higher returns. He wrote: This could benefit the entire crypto space, as small investors are likely to diversify into other projects, including DeFi, staking, futures, and other instruments. All signs point to this shift in retail behavior being the start of a new wave of mass adoption in the cryptocurrency market. Aleman also emphasized monitoring other on-chain indicators such as active addresses, unspent transaction output (UTXO) count, new addresses, and transfer volume, which often rise in tandem with growing retail activity. A Few Warning Signs For BTC While rising retail interest is encouraging, a few red flags suggest caution. Notably, the Exchange Stablecoins Ratio (USD) recently surged to 5.3 during Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to $104,000. This suggests that BTC reserves on exchanges now exceed stablecoin balances &#8211; a signal that selling pressure could be building. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashing Pre-Rally Signals Seen Before Major 2024 Breakouts, Analyst Says According to CryptoQuant contributor EgyHash, a reading above 5.0 is historically significant. A similar spike to 6.1 in January was followed by a sharp price correction, indicating that investors may be rotating from BTC back into cash. Despite some cautionary indicators, Bitcoin continues to exhibit bullish momentum. The Stochastic RSI is showing renewed strength, and other technical signals suggest the rally could continue. At press time, BTC trades at $103,993, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Tops $104K as Global Market Momentum Outpaces Korean Demand. Bitcoin has continued its steady ascent, with the asset now trading above $103,000. This marks a 0.4% decrease over the last 24 hours and more than 20% over the past month. While the rally has reaffirmed bullish sentiment in broader markets, recent data points to a shift in the sources driving this momentum. A CryptoQuant analyst has observed a growing disparity between regional and global market behavior, especially regarding the price of Bitcoin across different exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Upward Momentum as Global Investors Take the Lead CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain¬†recently analyzed a key metric known as the ‚ÄúKorea Premium,‚Äù which tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Korean exchanges and international platforms. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs rising market price, the Korea Premium has been on a consistent downward trend. This suggests the ongoing rally is largely being driven by institutional flows and investor sentiment in markets outside Korea, rather than from the historically active Korean retail segment. In previous cycles, particularly in 2017 and 2021, South Korean exchanges often traded BTC at a premium due to local demand surges, sometimes up to 20% higher than international prices. These periods were typically seen as signals of retail-driven euphoria. Avocado explains that this change in market dynamics reflects a new phase of capital distribution in the crypto space. With spot Bitcoin ETFs now operational in the US, and growing interest from corporations and even sovereign wealth entities, a larger share of trading activity is being driven by institutional strategies rather than retail speculation. This is reflected in the subdued Korea Premium, which failed to spike even as BTC crossed major resistance levels in recent months. Institutional Activity Redefines Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Drivers According to Avocado, even if a rebound occurs, any Korea Premium near 10%‚Äîonce considered modest‚Äîshould now be interpreted as elevated. The absence of excessive domestic premiums highlights that Asian retail is no longer setting the pace in Bitcoin markets. Instead, global institutional actors, armed with new vehicles like ETFs and custodial platforms, appear to be the primary drivers of demand. This shift is significant because it may signal more sustained and less volatile growth for Bitcoin, in contrast to previous boom-and-bust cycles fueled by retail enthusiasm. Related Reading: Buyers Take Control: Indicator That Predicted Previous Bitcoin Rallies Fires Again Avocado‚Äôs observations suggest a maturation of the crypto market. With retail sentiment lagging and institutional interest rising, Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory may now be more responsive to global macroeconomic events, policy shifts, and capital allocation trends from major asset managers. This evolving dynamic could also change how traders interpret volume spikes and volatility, especially as retail signals like the Korea Premium lose some of their predictive power.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors?. On-chain data shows the &#8216;Exchange Stablecoins Ratio&#8217; for Bitcoin has shot up recently. Here&#8217;s what it could mean for the asset&#8217;s price. Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Has Broken Above 5 As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has registered an increase alongside the latest rally in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. The Exchange Stablecoins Ratio here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Exchange Reserves of BTC and the stablecoins. The &#8220;Exchange Reserve&#8221; is naturally the total amount of the asset that&#8217;s sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This When the value of the indicator goes up, it means the Exchange Reserve of BTC is rising relative to that of the stablecoins. On the other hand, it going down implies stables are becoming more dominant on these platforms. The Exchange Reserve of both of these asset classes represents something different with respect to the wider sector. In the case of Bitcoin (and other such volatile assets), the Exchange Reserve can be looked at as a measure of the available selling pressure in the market. This is because of the fact that holders usually deposit their coins to these platforms when they intend to trade them away. The same remains true for the stablecoins as well, but since their price is &#8216;stable&#8217; by nature, selling from investors has no effect on it. While the selling of stablecoins doesn&#8217;t have any effect on their own price, it does hold implications for the volatile side of the market, if the stables are being swapped in favor of tokens like BTC. The assets being purchased using stables naturally feel a bullish effect on their price. As such, the Exchange Reserve of the stablecoins may be considered as a representation of the buying pressure in the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has been going up recently, a sign that investors have been depositing BTC at a faster rate than stablecoins. The metric is currently sitting at a value of 5.3, which suggests the BTC Exchange Reserve is more than five times that of the stablecoin one. This may be a bearish development for the cryptocurrency, as it implies the potential selling pressure in the sector notably outweighs the buying pressure that stables can bring. As the quant says, This surge above the 5.0 threshold echoes the late-January peak near 6.1, which preceded a swift correction‚Äîimplying traders may be gearing up to rotate BTC back into cash.

News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Whales About to Cash Out? Key Metric Signals Possible Profit-Taking Ahead. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent market movement reflects ongoing upward momentum, even as short-term fluctuations suggest some cooling. As of today, BTC trades at $103,485, reflecting a slight 0.6% dip in the last 24 hours and a near 10% decline over the past week. However, the asset remains just under 5% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January, continuing to hold a position near record levels. This pattern suggests Bitcoin may be entering a consolidation phase, supported by long-term bullish fundamentals. Amid this price performance, renewed activity among long-term holders is generating interest about the sustainability of the current price range and the potential for future volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? Bitcoin Binary CDD Signals Potential Market Rotation CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain recently highlighted a key indicator known as Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which helps assess the behavior of long-dormant Bitcoin. Binary CDD increases when older coins are moved after extended periods of inactivity, typically a sign of long-term holders re-entering the market or preparing to sell. Historically, spikes in Binary CDD have coincided with market tops or phases where distribution from early holders to newer market participants increases. According to Avocado, applying a 30-day moving average to Binary CDD smooths the data and provides a clearer view of macro trends. During previous Bitcoin rallies, including in late 2021 and during the twin peaks of 2024, the Binary CDD rose past the 0.8 threshold. That level historically signaled elevated movement from long-term holders, often aligning with increased selling pressure or profit-taking behavior. Currently, the indicator sits near 0.6 and is trending upward as Bitcoin attempts to retest its highs. If Binary CDD crosses the 0.8 mark again, it may suggest another wave of distribution is underway. Monitoring Profit Realization Behavior What makes Binary CDD useful is its ability to reflect potential shifts in market structure. When long-term holders begin moving large volumes of BTC, it often signals the start of profit-taking, especially if accompanied by high prices and strong market sentiment. However, the indicator alone does not confirm sell-offs; context, such as exchange inflows and broader trading data, is necessary to interpret it fully. In a broader sense, the current uptick in Binary CDD may point to Bitcoin entering a transitional stage. Rather than signaling the end of an uptrend, it could indicate that notable investors are gradually rotating capital or responding to price action in anticipation of near-term changes. In a separate market signal, another CryptoQuant analyst, EgyHash, highlighted concerns arising from the Exchange Stablecoins Ratio (USD), a metric that compares Bitcoin reserves to stablecoin holdings on exchanges. According to EgyHash, this ratio has climbed to around 5.3, surpassing the threshold of 5.0, which previously coincided with distribution phases in the market. A similar level in late January led to a pullback, and the current reading suggests that more traders may be preparing to sell, possibly rotating BTC holdings back into stablecoins or fiat equivalents.

News,Bitcoin,"Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold. Bitcoin has continued to maintain bullish momentum despite seeing a small correction after initially hitting $105,000. Its long stay above $100,000 has fueled the narrative that this rally is here to stay and higher prices are on the way. Presently, the price seems to be consolidating before moving upward, a region that crypto analyst Gert van Lagen has referred to as Trend Continuation. Bitcoin Price Is In Trend Continuation In an update analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), Gert van Lagen posited that the Bitcoin price has, in fact, now entered the Trend Continuation phase of the cycle. This comes after the Building Pre-Tension phase that began at the lows at $$76,000, ending in the impulse move that eventually pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 once again. Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance According to the shared chart, the Trend Continuation part of the cycle is when the Bitcoin price continues to explode, moving it all the way to new all-time highs. Gert‚Äôs chart shows that the BTC price is still more than 100% away from its cycle peak, which is shown at above $320,000 here. However, despite the bull market, there is still some hindrance for the Bitcoin price at this level. To confirm this Trend continuation, the price would have to break above $109,400. Not only must this level be broken, but it must hold it and mark a weekly close above it. The opposite of this happening would threaten the validity of the trend continuation. For the whole move to be invalidated, the crypto analyst explains that the Bitcoin price would have to put in a structural weekly close below $79,000. This would be a 25% crash from the current levels. Presently, Bitcoin is still stuck in a re-accumulation stage. Mapping Out The Road To $320,000 And Beyond If the Trend Continuation plays out, there are a number of other stages that the Bitcoin price is expected to go through. As mentioned above, the top for the next stage is $320,000, but once this is hit, the price is expected to go downhill from there. Related Reading: XRP Price At $10-$20 Only The Beginning, It‚Äôs Headed For $1,000 ‚Äì Analyst Reveals The next is the distribution phase as investors begin to move around their holdings and sell into the liquidity. Next, the crypto analyst predicts a fast price move triggering a crash back toward $100,000. Then a small recovery as tension builds and the Bitcoin price loses the uptrend. From here, another Trend Continuation will send the price further downward, and then toward more redistribution. This is then followed by another fast price move taking the Bitcoin price deeper into 5-digit territory, and then a full-blown recession. At the lowest, the crypto analyst sees BTC eventually falling below $10,300 again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.02,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T11:45:00.888026+00:00,

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen. Dogecoin‚Äôs price swung sharply higher last week, jumping from under $0.169 on May 8 to just over $0.248 by May 12. That‚Äôs a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‚Äëchain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‚ÄëTerm Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that‚Äôs been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE‚Äôs price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D &#8211; The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring. I&#8217;m calling for $1 $DOGE because I think it will extend higher to that psych level. All of this happens by the end of summer, imo. pic.twitter.com/V3rvmre1HR ‚Äî Chris (@StonkChris) May 13, 2025 Forecast Puts $1 Within Reach One independent analyst has mapped out a timeline pushing DOGE to $1 by the &#8220;end of summer&#8221; this year. That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE‚Äôs market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‚Äëchain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‚Äëbalance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That‚Äôs a strong shift compared to mid‚ÄëFebruary through April, when futures heat and DOGE‚Äôs price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‚Äëchain spikes sometimes come from short‚Äëterm bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

Smart contract logic enforces repayment, not a central authority. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s proven by math rather than trust,&rdquo; Duke said.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-looks-ridiculous-bulls-attempt-2t-market-cap-flip"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""><em><strong>Bitcoin looks &lsquo;ridiculous&rsquo; as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip &mdash; Analyst</strong></em></a></p><p>Duke said she is equally excited about trustless bridging, which could allow Bitcoin to interact with external computation platforms without compromising its decentralized ethos.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>&ldquo;If you could use Bitcoin not just as money but as a base asset that can trustlessly plug into any financial system, that would be&hellip; the end of the road for this asset.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Looking ahead, Jenkinson highlighted how Bitcoin-native DeFi could unlock real-world financial access for people excluded from traditional banking. &ldquo;A few little changes to some lines of code might just unlock [permissionless finance] for all of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the kind of future I&rsquo;m hopeful about.&rdquo;</p><p>To hear the full conversation on <em>The Clear Crypto Podcast</em>,&nbsp; listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/the-clear-crypto-podcast"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">page</a>, <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-clear-crypto-podcast/id1805146224"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4i4rBWOIDNxM0MGathWIzQ"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Spotify</a>.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

These incentives have turned the region into a prime destination for institutional-scale mining. Meanwhile, in the US, where industrial power costs often exceed $0.1 per kWh, miners face shrinking margins, forcing a migration toward more cost-efficient locations.

News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 EMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T15:45:00.929978+00:00,

News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T16:45:01.309727+00:00,

At the same time, <a href=""https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/difficulty"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">network difficulty has surged to an all-time high of 123T</a>, making it harder for miners to generate returns. To stay competitive, operations must extract maximum value from every watt of power consumed. This shift has intensified the search for cheap, reliable power, driving mining expansion into regions where energy costs remain low.</p><p>Electricity pricing now dictates mining profitability. In Oman, licensed miners benefit from government-backed subsidies, securing electricity at $0.05&ndash;$0.07 per kWh, while in the UAE, semi-governmental projects operate at even lower rates of $0.035&ndash;$0.045 per kWh. These incentives have turned the region into a prime destination for institutional-scale mining. Meanwhile, in the US, where industrial power costs often exceed $0.1 per kWh, miners face shrinking margins, forcing a migration toward more cost-efficient locations. Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia have emerged as key battlegrounds in this race, offering the energy arbitrage opportunities miners need to survive.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin mining 2025: Post-halving profitability, hashrate and energy trends"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196d3fc-c4a4-7496-8145-bd966aadc465"" title="""" /></figure><h2>What&rsquo;s next for Bitcoin mining?</h2><p>The 2024 halving has reinforced a hard truth: Efficiency is no longer optional; it&rsquo;s a necessity.

Smart contract logic enforces repayment, not a central authority. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s proven by math rather than trust,&rdquo; Duke said.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-looks-ridiculous-bulls-attempt-2t-market-cap-flip"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""><em><strong>Bitcoin looks &lsquo;ridiculous&rsquo; as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip &mdash; Analyst</strong></em></a></p><p>Duke said she is equally excited about trustless bridging, which could allow Bitcoin to interact with external computation platforms without compromising its decentralized ethos.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>&ldquo;If you could use Bitcoin not just as money but as a base asset that can trustlessly plug into any financial system, that would be&hellip; the end of the road for this asset.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Looking ahead, Jenkinson highlighted how Bitcoin-native DeFi could unlock real-world financial access for people excluded from traditional banking. &ldquo;A few little changes to some lines of code might just unlock [permissionless finance] for all of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the kind of future I&rsquo;m hopeful about.&rdquo;</p><p>To hear the full conversation on <em>The Clear Crypto Podcast</em>,&nbsp; listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/the-clear-crypto-podcast"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">page</a>, <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-clear-crypto-podcast/id1805146224"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4i4rBWOIDNxM0MGathWIzQ"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Spotify</a>.

News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T17:45:00.874340+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

News,Bitcoin,"Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold. Bitcoin has continued to maintain bullish momentum despite seeing a small correction after initially hitting $105,000. Its long stay above $100,000 has fueled the narrative that this rally is here to stay and higher prices are on the way. Presently, the price seems to be consolidating before moving upward, a region that crypto analyst Gert van Lagen has referred to as Trend Continuation. Bitcoin Price Is In Trend Continuation In an update analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), Gert van Lagen posited that the Bitcoin price has, in fact, now entered the Trend Continuation phase of the cycle. This comes after the Building Pre-Tension phase that began at the lows at $$76,000, ending in the impulse move that eventually pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 once again. Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance According to the shared chart, the Trend Continuation part of the cycle is when the Bitcoin price continues to explode, moving it all the way to new all-time highs. Gert‚Äôs chart shows that the BTC price is still more than 100% away from its cycle peak, which is shown at above $320,000 here. However, despite the bull market, there is still some hindrance for the Bitcoin price at this level. To confirm this Trend continuation, the price would have to break above $109,400. Not only must this level be broken, but it must hold it and mark a weekly close above it. The opposite of this happening would threaten the validity of the trend continuation. For the whole move to be invalidated, the crypto analyst explains that the Bitcoin price would have to put in a structural weekly close below $79,000. This would be a 25% crash from the current levels. Presently, Bitcoin is still stuck in a re-accumulation stage. Mapping Out The Road To $320,000 And Beyond If the Trend Continuation plays out, there are a number of other stages that the Bitcoin price is expected to go through. As mentioned above, the top for the next stage is $320,000, but once this is hit, the price is expected to go downhill from there.

Next, the crypto analyst predicts a fast price move triggering a crash back toward $100,000. Then a small recovery as tension builds and the Bitcoin price loses the uptrend. From here, another Trend Continuation will send the price further downward, and then toward more redistribution. This is then followed by another fast price move taking the Bitcoin price deeper into 5-digit territory, and then a full-blown recession. At the lowest, the crypto analyst sees BTC eventually falling below $10,300 again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.02,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T17:45:00.874340+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Are Bitcoin Whales About to Cash Out? Key Metric Signals Possible Profit-Taking Ahead. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent market movement reflects ongoing upward momentum, even as short-term fluctuations suggest some cooling. As of today, BTC trades at $103,485, reflecting a slight 0.6% dip in the last 24 hours and a near 10% decline over the past week. However, the asset remains just under 5% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January, continuing to hold a position near record levels. This pattern suggests Bitcoin may be entering a consolidation phase, supported by long-term bullish fundamentals. Amid this price performance, renewed activity among long-term holders is generating interest about the sustainability of the current price range and the potential for future volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Still No Extreme Greed: Green Sign For Bull Run? Bitcoin Binary CDD Signals Potential Market Rotation CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain recently highlighted a key indicator known as Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which helps assess the behavior of long-dormant Bitcoin. Binary CDD increases when older coins are moved after extended periods of inactivity, typically a sign of long-term holders re-entering the market or preparing to sell. Historically, spikes in Binary CDD have coincided with market tops or phases where distribution from early holders to newer market participants increases. According to Avocado, applying a 30-day moving average to Binary CDD smooths the data and provides a clearer view of macro trends. During previous Bitcoin rallies, including in late 2021 and during the twin peaks of 2024, the Binary CDD rose past the 0.8 threshold. That level historically signaled elevated movement from long-term holders, often aligning with increased selling pressure or profit-taking behavior. Currently, the indicator sits near 0.6 and is trending upward as Bitcoin attempts to retest its highs. If Binary CDD crosses the 0.8 mark again, it may suggest another wave of distribution is underway. Monitoring Profit Realization Behavior What makes Binary CDD useful is its ability to reflect potential shifts in market structure. When long-term holders begin moving large volumes of BTC, it often signals the start of profit-taking, especially if accompanied by high prices and strong market sentiment. However, the indicator alone does not confirm sell-offs; context, such as exchange inflows and broader trading data, is necessary to interpret it fully. In a broader sense, the current uptick in Binary CDD may point to Bitcoin entering a transitional stage. Rather than signaling the end of an uptrend, it could indicate that notable investors are gradually rotating capital or responding to price action in anticipation of near-term changes. In a separate market signal, another CryptoQuant analyst, EgyHash, highlighted concerns arising from the Exchange Stablecoins Ratio (USD), a metric that compares Bitcoin reserves to stablecoin holdings on exchanges. According to EgyHash, this ratio has climbed to around 5.3, surpassing the threshold of 5.0, which previously coincided with distribution phases in the market. A similar level in late January led to a pullback, and the current reading suggests that more traders may be preparing to sell, possibly rotating BTC holdings back into stablecoins or fiat equivalents.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen. Dogecoin‚Äôs price swung sharply higher last week, jumping from under $0.169 on May 8 to just over $0.248 by May 12. That‚Äôs a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‚Äëchain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‚ÄëTerm Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that‚Äôs been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE‚Äôs price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D &#8211; The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring. I&#8217;m calling for $1 $DOGE because I think it will extend higher to that psych level. All of this happens by the end of summer, imo. pic.twitter.com/V3rvmre1HR ‚Äî Chris (@StonkChris) May 13, 2025 Forecast Puts $1 Within Reach One independent analyst has mapped out a timeline pushing DOGE to $1 by the &#8220;end of summer&#8221; this year. That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE‚Äôs market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‚Äëchain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‚Äëbalance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That‚Äôs a strong shift compared to mid‚ÄëFebruary through April, when futures heat and DOGE‚Äôs price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‚Äëchain spikes sometimes come from short‚Äëterm bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

It&rsquo;s about potential.&nbsp;<p>On this week&rsquo;s episode of <em>The Clear Crypto Podcast</em>, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Isabel Foxen Duke, general partner at Unbroken Chain and longtime Bitcoin advocate, to unpack what she calls &ldquo;Bitcoin Season 2.&rdquo;</p><h2>Bitcoin beyond money</h2><p>&ldquo;Bitcoin Season 2 is really about seeing what we can do with Bitcoin outside of just being money,&rdquo; said Duke. </p><blockquote>&ldquo;What are the broad range of financial use cases for [Bitcoin] other than just being money by itself?&rdquo;</blockquote><p>New developments like ordinals, runes, and decentralized financial (DeFi) tools are pushing Bitcoin beyond its traditional identity as a digital store of value. </p><p>One key innovation under discussion is trustless lending &mdash; allowing users to borrow against their Bitcoin without involving third-party intermediaries. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the ability to lend against our Bitcoin in a trustless way without third-party intermediaries,&rdquo; Duke said. </p><blockquote>&ldquo;I would argue that is the second most important and second most used use case in the real world other than making payments.&rdquo;</blockquote><h2><strong>Lending on Bitcoin</strong></h2><p>One emerging solution involves Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which let users maintain control of their Bitcoin while locking it as collateral. Smart contract logic enforces repayment, not a central authority. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s proven by math rather than trust,&rdquo; Duke said.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-looks-ridiculous-bulls-attempt-2t-market-cap-flip"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""><em><strong>Bitcoin looks &lsquo;ridiculous&rsquo; as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip &mdash; Analyst</strong></em></a></p><p>Duke said she is equally excited about trustless bridging, which could allow Bitcoin to interact with external computation platforms without compromising its decentralized ethos.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>&ldquo;If you could use Bitcoin not just as money but as a base asset that can trustlessly plug into any financial system, that would be&hellip; the end of the road for this asset.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Looking ahead, Jenkinson highlighted how Bitcoin-native DeFi could unlock real-world financial access for people excluded from traditional banking. &ldquo;A few little changes to some lines of code might just unlock [permissionless finance] for all of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the kind of future I&rsquo;m hopeful about.&rdquo;</p><p>To hear the full conversation on <em>The Clear Crypto Podcast</em>,&nbsp; listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/the-clear-crypto-podcast"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">page</a>, <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-clear-crypto-podcast/id1805146224"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4i4rBWOIDNxM0MGathWIzQ"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Spotify</a>.

News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

News,Bitcoin,"Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold. Bitcoin has continued to maintain bullish momentum despite seeing a small correction after initially hitting $105,000. Its long stay above $100,000 has fueled the narrative that this rally is here to stay and higher prices are on the way. Presently, the price seems to be consolidating before moving upward, a region that crypto analyst Gert van Lagen has referred to as Trend Continuation. Bitcoin Price Is In Trend Continuation In an update analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), Gert van Lagen posited that the Bitcoin price has, in fact, now entered the Trend Continuation phase of the cycle. This comes after the Building Pre-Tension phase that began at the lows at $$76,000, ending in the impulse move that eventually pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 once again. Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance According to the shared chart, the Trend Continuation part of the cycle is when the Bitcoin price continues to explode, moving it all the way to new all-time highs. Gert‚Äôs chart shows that the BTC price is still more than 100% away from its cycle peak, which is shown at above $320,000 here. However, despite the bull market, there is still some hindrance for the Bitcoin price at this level. To confirm this Trend continuation, the price would have to break above $109,400. Not only must this level be broken, but it must hold it and mark a weekly close above it. The opposite of this happening would threaten the validity of the trend continuation. For the whole move to be invalidated, the crypto analyst explains that the Bitcoin price would have to put in a structural weekly close below $79,000. This would be a 25% crash from the current levels. Presently, Bitcoin is still stuck in a re-accumulation stage. Mapping Out The Road To $320,000 And Beyond If the Trend Continuation plays out, there are a number of other stages that the Bitcoin price is expected to go through. As mentioned above, the top for the next stage is $320,000, but once this is hit, the price is expected to go downhill from there. Related Reading: XRP Price At $10-$20 Only The Beginning, It‚Äôs Headed For $1,000 ‚Äì Analyst Reveals The next is the distribution phase as investors begin to move around their holdings and sell into the liquidity. Next, the crypto analyst predicts a fast price move triggering a crash back toward $100,000. Then a small recovery as tension builds and the Bitcoin price loses the uptrend. From here, another Trend Continuation will send the price further downward, and then toward more redistribution. This is then followed by another fast price move taking the Bitcoin price deeper into 5-digit territory, and then a full-blown recession. At the lowest, the crypto analyst sees BTC eventually falling below $10,300 again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.02,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T18:45:00.922670+00:00,

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen. Dogecoin‚Äôs price swung sharply higher last week, jumping from under $0.169 on May 8 to just over $0.248 by May 12. That‚Äôs a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‚Äëchain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‚ÄëTerm Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that‚Äôs been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE‚Äôs price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D &#8211; The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring.

That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE‚Äôs market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‚Äëchain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‚Äëbalance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That‚Äôs a strong shift compared to mid‚ÄëFebruary through April, when futures heat and DOGE‚Äôs price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‚Äëchain spikes sometimes come from short‚Äëterm bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

At the same time, <a href=""https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/difficulty"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">network difficulty has surged to an all-time high of 123T</a>, making it harder for miners to generate returns. To stay competitive, operations must extract maximum value from every watt of power consumed. This shift has intensified the search for cheap, reliable power, driving mining expansion into regions where energy costs remain low.</p><p>Electricity pricing now dictates mining profitability. In Oman, licensed miners benefit from government-backed subsidies, securing electricity at $0.05&ndash;$0.07 per kWh, while in the UAE, semi-governmental projects operate at even lower rates of $0.035&ndash;$0.045 per kWh. These incentives have turned the region into a prime destination for institutional-scale mining. Meanwhile, in the US, where industrial power costs often exceed $0.1 per kWh, miners face shrinking margins, forcing a migration toward more cost-efficient locations. Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia have emerged as key battlegrounds in this race, offering the energy arbitrage opportunities miners need to survive.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin mining 2025: Post-halving profitability, hashrate and energy trends"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196d3fc-c4a4-7496-8145-bd966aadc465"" title="""" /></figure><h2>What&rsquo;s next for Bitcoin mining?</h2><p>The 2024 halving has reinforced a hard truth: Efficiency is no longer optional; it&rsquo;s a necessity.

Smart contract logic enforces repayment, not a central authority. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s proven by math rather than trust,&rdquo; Duke said.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-looks-ridiculous-bulls-attempt-2t-market-cap-flip"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""><em><strong>Bitcoin looks &lsquo;ridiculous&rsquo; as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip &mdash; Analyst</strong></em></a></p><p>Duke said she is equally excited about trustless bridging, which could allow Bitcoin to interact with external computation platforms without compromising its decentralized ethos.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>&ldquo;If you could use Bitcoin not just as money but as a base asset that can trustlessly plug into any financial system, that would be&hellip; the end of the road for this asset.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Looking ahead, Jenkinson highlighted how Bitcoin-native DeFi could unlock real-world financial access for people excluded from traditional banking. &ldquo;A few little changes to some lines of code might just unlock [permissionless finance] for all of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the kind of future I&rsquo;m hopeful about.&rdquo;</p><p>To hear the full conversation on <em>The Clear Crypto Podcast</em>,&nbsp; listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/the-clear-crypto-podcast"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">page</a>, <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-clear-crypto-podcast/id1805146224"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4i4rBWOIDNxM0MGathWIzQ"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Spotify</a>.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T19:03:04.297687+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T19:03:04.297687+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

News,Bitcoin,"Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold. Bitcoin has continued to maintain bullish momentum despite seeing a small correction after initially hitting $105,000. Its long stay above $100,000 has fueled the narrative that this rally is here to stay and higher prices are on the way. Presently, the price seems to be consolidating before moving upward, a region that crypto analyst Gert van Lagen has referred to as Trend Continuation. Bitcoin Price Is In Trend Continuation In an update analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), Gert van Lagen posited that the Bitcoin price has, in fact, now entered the Trend Continuation phase of the cycle. This comes after the Building Pre-Tension phase that began at the lows at $$76,000, ending in the impulse move that eventually pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 once again. Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance According to the shared chart, the Trend Continuation part of the cycle is when the Bitcoin price continues to explode, moving it all the way to new all-time highs. Gert‚Äôs chart shows that the BTC price is still more than 100% away from its cycle peak, which is shown at above $320,000 here. However, despite the bull market, there is still some hindrance for the Bitcoin price at this level. To confirm this Trend continuation, the price would have to break above $109,400. Not only must this level be broken, but it must hold it and mark a weekly close above it. The opposite of this happening would threaten the validity of the trend continuation. For the whole move to be invalidated, the crypto analyst explains that the Bitcoin price would have to put in a structural weekly close below $79,000. This would be a 25% crash from the current levels. Presently, Bitcoin is still stuck in a re-accumulation stage. Mapping Out The Road To $320,000 And Beyond If the Trend Continuation plays out, there are a number of other stages that the Bitcoin price is expected to go through. As mentioned above, the top for the next stage is $320,000, but once this is hit, the price is expected to go downhill from there. Related Reading: XRP Price At $10-$20 Only The Beginning, It‚Äôs Headed For $1,000 ‚Äì Analyst Reveals The next is the distribution phase as investors begin to move around their holdings and sell into the liquidity. Next, the crypto analyst predicts a fast price move triggering a crash back toward $100,000. Then a small recovery as tension builds and the Bitcoin price loses the uptrend. From here, another Trend Continuation will send the price further downward, and then toward more redistribution. This is then followed by another fast price move taking the Bitcoin price deeper into 5-digit territory, and then a full-blown recession. At the lowest, the crypto analyst sees BTC eventually falling below $10,300 again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.02,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T19:03:04.297687+00:00,

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen. Dogecoin‚Äôs price swung sharply higher last week, jumping from under $0.169 on May 8 to just over $0.248 by May 12. That‚Äôs a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‚Äëchain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‚ÄëTerm Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that‚Äôs been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE‚Äôs price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D &#8211; The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring. I&#8217;m calling for $1 $DOGE because I think it will extend higher to that psych level. All of this happens by the end of summer, imo. pic.twitter.com/V3rvmre1HR ‚Äî Chris (@StonkChris) May 13, 2025 Forecast Puts $1 Within Reach One independent analyst has mapped out a timeline pushing DOGE to $1 by the &#8220;end of summer&#8221; this year. That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE‚Äôs market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‚Äëchain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‚Äëbalance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That‚Äôs a strong shift compared to mid‚ÄëFebruary through April, when futures heat and DOGE‚Äôs price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‚Äëchain spikes sometimes come from short‚Äëterm bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

These incentives have turned the region into a prime destination for institutional-scale mining.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T19:45:00.934168+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T19:45:00.934168+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

News,Bitcoin,"Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold. Bitcoin has continued to maintain bullish momentum despite seeing a small correction after initially hitting $105,000. Its long stay above $100,000 has fueled the narrative that this rally is here to stay and higher prices are on the way. Presently, the price seems to be consolidating before moving upward, a region that crypto analyst Gert van Lagen has referred to as Trend Continuation. Bitcoin Price Is In Trend Continuation In an update analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), Gert van Lagen posited that the Bitcoin price has, in fact, now entered the Trend Continuation phase of the cycle. This comes after the Building Pre-Tension phase that began at the lows at $$76,000, ending in the impulse move that eventually pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 once again. Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance According to the shared chart, the Trend Continuation part of the cycle is when the Bitcoin price continues to explode, moving it all the way to new all-time highs. Gert‚Äôs chart shows that the BTC price is still more than 100% away from its cycle peak, which is shown at above $320,000 here. However, despite the bull market, there is still some hindrance for the Bitcoin price at this level. To confirm this Trend continuation, the price would have to break above $109,400. Not only must this level be broken, but it must hold it and mark a weekly close above it. The opposite of this happening would threaten the validity of the trend continuation. For the whole move to be invalidated, the crypto analyst explains that the Bitcoin price would have to put in a structural weekly close below $79,000. This would be a 25% crash from the current levels. Presently, Bitcoin is still stuck in a re-accumulation stage. Mapping Out The Road To $320,000 And Beyond If the Trend Continuation plays out, there are a number of other stages that the Bitcoin price is expected to go through. As mentioned above, the top for the next stage is $320,000, but once this is hit, the price is expected to go downhill from there. Related Reading: XRP Price At $10-$20 Only The Beginning, It‚Äôs Headed For $1,000 ‚Äì Analyst Reveals The next is the distribution phase as investors begin to move around their holdings and sell into the liquidity. Next, the crypto analyst predicts a fast price move triggering a crash back toward $100,000. Then a small recovery as tension builds and the Bitcoin price loses the uptrend. From here, another Trend Continuation will send the price further downward, and then toward more redistribution. This is then followed by another fast price move taking the Bitcoin price deeper into 5-digit territory, and then a full-blown recession. At the lowest, the crypto analyst sees BTC eventually falling below $10,300 again. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.02,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T19:45:00.934168+00:00,

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen. Dogecoin‚Äôs price swung sharply higher last week, jumping from under $0.169 on May 8 to just over $0.248 by May 12. That‚Äôs a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‚Äëchain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‚ÄëTerm Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that‚Äôs been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE‚Äôs price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D &#8211; The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring. I&#8217;m calling for $1 $DOGE because I think it will extend higher to that psych level. All of this happens by the end of summer, imo. pic.twitter.com/V3rvmre1HR ‚Äî Chris (@StonkChris) May 13, 2025 Forecast Puts $1 Within Reach One independent analyst has mapped out a timeline pushing DOGE to $1 by the &#8220;end of summer&#8221; this year. That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE‚Äôs market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‚Äëchain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‚Äëbalance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That‚Äôs a strong shift compared to mid‚ÄëFebruary through April, when futures heat and DOGE‚Äôs price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‚Äëchain spikes sometimes come from short‚Äëterm bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

This shift has intensified the search for cheap, reliable power, driving mining expansion into regions where energy costs remain low.</p><p>Electricity pricing now dictates mining profitability. In Oman, licensed miners benefit from government-backed subsidies, securing electricity at $0.05&ndash;$0.07 per kWh, while in the UAE, semi-governmental projects operate at even lower rates of $0.035&ndash;$0.045 per kWh. These incentives have turned the region into a prime destination for institutional-scale mining. Meanwhile, in the US, where industrial power costs often exceed $0.1 per kWh, miners face shrinking margins, forcing a migration toward more cost-efficient locations. Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia have emerged as key battlegrounds in this race, offering the energy arbitrage opportunities miners need to survive.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin mining 2025: Post-halving profitability, hashrate and energy trends"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196d3fc-c4a4-7496-8145-bd966aadc465"" title="""" /></figure><h2>What&rsquo;s next for Bitcoin mining?</h2><p>The 2024 halving has reinforced a hard truth: Efficiency is no longer optional; it&rsquo;s a necessity.

Smart contract logic enforces repayment, not a central authority. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s proven by math rather than trust,&rdquo; Duke said.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-looks-ridiculous-bulls-attempt-2t-market-cap-flip"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""><em><strong>Bitcoin looks &lsquo;ridiculous&rsquo; as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip &mdash; Analyst</strong></em></a></p><p>Duke said she is equally excited about trustless bridging, which could allow Bitcoin to interact with external computation platforms without compromising its decentralized ethos.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>&ldquo;If you could use Bitcoin not just as money but as a base asset that can trustlessly plug into any financial system, that would be&hellip; the end of the road for this asset.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Looking ahead, Jenkinson highlighted how Bitcoin-native DeFi could unlock real-world financial access for people excluded from traditional banking. &ldquo;A few little changes to some lines of code might just unlock [permissionless finance] for all of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the kind of future I&rsquo;m hopeful about.&rdquo;</p><p>To hear the full conversation on <em>The Clear Crypto Podcast</em>,&nbsp; listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph&rsquo;s Podcasts <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/the-clear-crypto-podcast"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">page</a>, <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-clear-crypto-podcast/id1805146224"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4i4rBWOIDNxM0MGathWIzQ"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Spotify</a>.

XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high.

News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T20:45:00.370601+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen. Dogecoin‚Äôs price swung sharply higher last week, jumping from under $0.169 on May 8 to just over $0.248 by May 12. That‚Äôs a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‚Äëchain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‚ÄëTerm Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that‚Äôs been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE‚Äôs price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D &#8211; The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring. I&#8217;m calling for $1 $DOGE because I think it will extend higher to that psych level. All of this happens by the end of summer, imo. pic.twitter.com/V3rvmre1HR ‚Äî Chris (@StonkChris) May 13, 2025 Forecast Puts $1 Within Reach One independent analyst has mapped out a timeline pushing DOGE to $1 by the &#8220;end of summer&#8221; this year. That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE‚Äôs market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‚Äëchain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‚Äëbalance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That‚Äôs a strong shift compared to mid‚ÄëFebruary through April, when futures heat and DOGE‚Äôs price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‚Äëchain spikes sometimes come from short‚Äëterm bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T21:45:00.933222+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T21:45:00.933222+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen. Dogecoin‚Äôs price swung sharply higher last week, jumping from under $0.169 on May 8 to just over $0.248 by May 12. That‚Äôs a 35% gain in seven days. Traders and investors are watching closely, as some charts and on‚Äëchain data point to more upside ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Breakout Above Long‚ÄëTerm Barrier According to chart watchers on X, Dogecoin cleared a descending trendline that‚Äôs been capping gains since January 2025. That line had knocked back rallies around $0.43, $0.19 and $0.16. Now, with prices trading above it, some see a fresh floor under DOGE‚Äôs price action. Ichimoku Cloud Turns Support Based on data, the Ichimoku cloud has flipped bullish. After the price moved above the cloud, the green span settled above the red. For many traders, that shift turns what was once resistance into a cushion for future climbs. Fibonacci Levels Point Higher Analysts have also plotted Fibonacci extensions on the recent move. The 1.619 level sits at $0.69 and the 2.0 level at $0.81. If Dogecoin follows that path, these lines could mark key stopovers on the road up. $DOGE 1D &#8211; The technical fib target for Dogecoin is the green box above with this daily breakout occuring. I&#8217;m calling for $1 $DOGE because I think it will extend higher to that psych level. All of this happens by the end of summer, imo. pic.twitter.com/V3rvmre1HR ‚Äî Chris (@StonkChris) May 13, 2025 Forecast Puts $1 Within Reach One independent analyst has mapped out a timeline pushing DOGE to $1 by the &#8220;end of summer&#8221; this year. That would require a whopping 320% rise from its current $0.2317 price. If it happens, market value could swell to almost $150 billion, up from roughly $34.5 billion today. DOGE‚Äôs market cap rose 3.4% over the past 24 hours alone. Network Activity Ramps Up On‚Äëchain figures back the buzz. New addresses have climbed over 100% in a week, active wallets are up 110%, and zero‚Äëbalance addresses jumped 154%. Those moves hint at growing retail interest and wider engagement beyond quick trades. Futures Traders Stay Busy Meanwhile, futures open interest on Dogecoin has surged from $989 million to $1.62 billion. That‚Äôs a strong shift compared to mid‚ÄëFebruary through April, when futures heat and DOGE‚Äôs price rose and fell together. Now, open interest keeps climbing despite a pullback from $0.25 to around $0.22. Related Reading: Price Down, Bets Up: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $1.62 Billion Other Voices Eyeing $1 Mark Studies last year showed that Dogecoin could hit $1 and push its market cap near $100 billion in 2025. Another market watcher has tracked a cup‚Äëand‚Äëhandle pattern forming since 2021, and uses it to project a $0.80 price target. What This Means For Traders Momentum is clearly building, but history warns against getting too carried away. Trendlines can be broken on low volume and bounce back into place. Fibonacci levels offer guidance, not guarantees. And on‚Äëchain spikes sometimes come from short‚Äëterm bots or wash trading. That said, a clear move above these technical hurdles could open the door to bigger swings. Risk management remains crucial.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators. These include a breakout with substantial trading volume, an RSI reading above 70 on the weekly chart, and a weekly close above the upper Bollinger Band.¬† Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 At the moment, however, the Bitcoin CME Futures chart has failed to move past 70 on the daily RSI twice, and trading volume is in decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading volume of Bitcoin is $44.33 billion in the past 24 hours, a 11.40% reduction from the previous 24 hours. These are early warning signs that a breakout attempt may lack the strength needed for sustainability. Nonetheless, the conditions are still very mixed and starting to lean more bullish than bearish. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,352, down by 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T22:45:00.860714+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T22:45:00.860714+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert. In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CIO of Maelstrom, draws a stark parallel between America‚Äôs growing economic imbalances and its unsustainable reliance on foreign capital‚Äîand argues that capital controls, not tariffs, are the only politically viable solution to rebalance the system. In what he dubs the ‚ÄúBoiling Frog Theory,‚Äù Hayes foresees a slow, stealthy imposition of financial restrictions on foreign investors that will ultimately accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $1 million by 2028. Titled Fatty Fatty Boom Boom, the essay begins with a provocative metaphor: America‚Äôs bloated financial system is likened to the obesity crisis‚Äîa pathology enabled by cheap processed inputs and pharmaceutical band-aids that preserve a diseased status quo. ‚ÄúThe American economy was hijacked by printed money,‚Äù Hayes writes, tracing the origin of US imbalances back to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inception in 1913 and the permanent shift away from natural business cycles to a regime of endless stimulus. Why Capital Control&#8217;s Could Drive Bitcoin To $1 Million Tariffs, according to Hayes, are politically and structurally impotent. Even under Trump, their application will be diluted through bilateral carve-outs and geopolitical concessions, allowing countries like Vietnam and Mexico to act as arbitrage hubs. ‚ÄúWithout one tariff for all, there will always be a country or countries that act as trans-shipment arbitrage points,‚Äù he explains, noting that this same dynamic lets China skirt semiconductor restrictions via third-party intermediaries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Treasury Firms Are This Cycle‚Äôs Bubble, Experts Warn Instead, Hayes sees capital controls‚Äîspecifically taxes on foreign ownership of US financial assets‚Äîas the only strategy with both economic bite and political payoff. He proposes a 2% annual tax on foreign-held stocks, bonds, and property, totaling approximately $33 trillion. Such a levy could eliminate federal income taxes for the bottom 90% of Americans, making it a ‚Äúwinning political strategy‚Äù for Team Trump. ‚ÄúEither foreign capital stays, pays the tax, and revenue is used to eliminate income taxes‚Ä¶ or foreign capital leaves, and American manufacturing grows,‚Äù Hayes argues. But if capital leaves, who replaces it? Hayes is blunt: the US will turn to the printing press. ‚ÄúRemember that 4/4 kick drum, the Brrr button. Y‚Äôall know what the answer is,‚Äù he quips, referring to the return of quantitative easing, the suspension of QT, treasury buybacks, and loosened regulatory constraints like the supplemental leverage ratio. Hayes believes the Fed, despite rhetorical resistance, is already enabling this stealth monetization by targeting long-duration treasury bonds for QE. ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs ass is sat firmly in the cuck chair, and he ain‚Äôt leaving. Now pass the lube,‚Äù he writes, in typical Hayes fashion. The ultimate effect of this capital exodus and ensuing monetary response, he contends, will be the devaluation of US treasuries in real terms and the reallocation of global capital into stateless, censorship-resistant assets like Bitcoin. Unlike gold, which requires intermediaries to function in the digital realm, Bitcoin is a native digital bearer asset that can operate outside state-controlled financial infrastructure. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,‚Äù he asserts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Is Far From Over‚ÄîTop Expert Predicts Surge To $150,000 Hayes notes that even the Trump administration appears ideologically aligned with Bitcoin and gold, pointing to the removal of tariffs on gold and the regulatory de-escalation around crypto. With these assets potentially being elevated to reserve status, Bitcoin is poised to absorb capital fleeing dollar-denominated instruments. In his forecast, Hayes considers the migration of even 10% of foreign-held US portfolio assets‚Äî$3.3 trillion‚Äîinto Bitcoin. At current market depth, that would trigger a supply shock far beyond a simple 10x price move. ‚ÄúIf 10x the amount of capital attempted to squeeze into the market, it would lead to a much greater than a 10x rise in price,‚Äù he predicts, citing the inelastic supply and long-term holders unwilling to sell. The result? A path to $1 million per Bitcoin by the 2028 US presidential election. Hayes also reveals that Maelstrom went ‚Äúmaximum long‚Äù during the early April financial turmoil and is now rotating into ‚Äúquality altcoins‚Äù, which he believes offer real services and return profits to token holders. Still, he warns of tactical volatility, noting that Trump‚Äôs strategy is fluid and opposition within the administration remains. But for Hayes, the trajectory is clear. Capital controls are no longer fringe theory‚Äîthey are becoming inevitable policy. And Bitcoin, he concludes, is the only asset positioned to benefit from the collapse of Pax Americana‚Äôs financial plumbing. At press time, BTC traded at $102,377.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

Until then, consolidation and caution dominate the short-term outlook. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.04,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T22:45:00.860714+00:00,

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators. These include a breakout with substantial trading volume, an RSI reading above 70 on the weekly chart, and a weekly close above the upper Bollinger Band.¬† Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 At the moment, however, the Bitcoin CME Futures chart has failed to move past 70 on the daily RSI twice, and trading volume is in decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading volume of Bitcoin is $44.33 billion in the past 24 hours, a 11.40% reduction from the previous 24 hours. These are early warning signs that a breakout attempt may lack the strength needed for sustainability. Nonetheless, the conditions are still very mixed and starting to lean more bullish than bearish. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,352, down by 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T23:45:00.957059+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-15T23:45:00.957059+00:00,

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators. These include a breakout with substantial trading volume, an RSI reading above 70 on the weekly chart, and a weekly close above the upper Bollinger Band.¬† Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 At the moment, however, the Bitcoin CME Futures chart has failed to move past 70 on the daily RSI twice, and trading volume is in decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading volume of Bitcoin is $44.33 billion in the past 24 hours, a 11.40% reduction from the previous 24 hours. These are early warning signs that a breakout attempt may lack the strength needed for sustainability. Nonetheless, the conditions are still very mixed and starting to lean more bullish than bearish. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,352, down by 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T00:45:07.439173+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T00:45:07.439173+00:00,

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators. These include a breakout with substantial trading volume, an RSI reading above 70 on the weekly chart, and a weekly close above the upper Bollinger Band.¬† Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 At the moment, however, the Bitcoin CME Futures chart has failed to move past 70 on the daily RSI twice, and trading volume is in decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading volume of Bitcoin is $44.33 billion in the past 24 hours, a 11.40% reduction from the previous 24 hours. These are early warning signs that a breakout attempt may lack the strength needed for sustainability. Nonetheless, the conditions are still very mixed and starting to lean more bullish than bearish. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,352, down by 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T01:45:00.862755+00:00,
News,Bitcoin,"Historic Bitcoin Indicator Predicts Bitcoin $200K Target: Next Crypto to Explode. Bitcoin is right at the center of most digital asset projections, and understandably so. After all, the &#8216;digital gold&#8217; is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world and the one that decides the entire market&#8217;s health. This article will inform you about a positive flip in a sensational momentum indicator that has been proven to predict forthcoming $BTC rallies. Remember, this particular indicator correctly called the 2023 and 2024 $BTC bull runs. Read on as we dive into the details of Bitcoin&#8217;s chart. We&#8217;ll also mention four tokens that could be the next crypto to explode. The MACD Histogram Turns Bullish When discussing any technical indicator, it&#8217;s important to understand what it means. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is essentially the difference between the MACD line and its signal line. Moreover, the MACD line is arrived at by subtracting the 26-period EMA (exponential moving average) from the 12-period EMA of the asset, which in this case is $BTC. The signal line, on the other hand, is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A flip to green in the MACD histogram is considered to be an extremely bullish signal, doubly so because of its historical accuracy. For instance, the indicator turned positive in the second half of October 2024, October 2023, and August 2022. Each time, $BTC rallied quite heavily. Considering previous percentage gains in $BTC after the MACD histogram turned green, analysts are hopeful of a $200K target for Bitcoin this time around. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, though, that the MACD histogram churned out a false signal in March 2022. Still, with 5 correct predictions in 6 instances, the indicator&#8217;s accuracy sits at over 83%. What&#8217;s more, $BTC&#8217;s current bounce is also coming from the 50 SMA (on the weekly chart), which is a strong bullish signal in itself. Now, if you want to make the most of Bitcoin&#8217;s imminent bull run, we suggest investing in the top altcoins that stand to benefit from $BTC&#8217;s strength. To help you get started, here are four awesome suggestions. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Bitcoin-Inspired Meme Coin Right Now It&#8217;s not just BTC Bull Token&#8217;s name or its website&#8217;s golden theme that makes it the best Bitcoin-themed altcoin today. No, this new crypto is entirely based upon Bitcoin&#8217;s lofty future targets. So, with $BTC staring at new all-time highs, there&#8217;s no doubt that $BTCBULL is at the top of the best cryptos to buy now. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out thanks to its never-before-seen airdrops. Instead of giving away more of its own tokens for free, the developers have decided to airdrop free $BTC to token holders who store their $BTCBULL in Best Wallet. The airdrops have been slated to take place every time Bitcoin jumps $50K in price, with the first milestone being $100K, followed by $125K, $150K, and so on. What&#8217;s more, this unique Bitcoin-loving meme coin has also planned to follow a deflationary model. Under this, the total $BTCBULL token supply will be reduced by a little bit every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price rises by $25K. Combined with a huge 40% of the total supply being reserved for marketing purposes, investors can rest assured that there will be no shortage of fuel for BTC Bull Token to become one of the top trending cryptos. To make the most of $BTCBULL&#8217;s growth, become an early investor in the project. It&#8217;s currently in presale ($5.8M+ raised), and each token is available for just $0.002515. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy¬†BTC¬†Bull¬†Token. 2. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) ‚Äì Donald Trump&#8217;s Very Own Meme Coin There&#8217;s really no debating Donald Trump&#8217;s influence on crypto. His pro-crypto stance was almost single-handedly responsible for the massive November 2024 rally. It&#8217;s also why we&#8217;re seeing so many crypto-friendly regulatory and administrative (for example, a slew of SEC officials have been replaced) changes in the US. With the POTUS acting on his promises to end crypto hostility from regulators and publicly declaring support for digital assets, of course, his own meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP), is in a pole position to become the next big crypto coin. After skyrocketing over 12,000% immediately after its launch in January 2025, $TRUMP saw a steady decline due to the president&#8217;s tariff war. However, the best PolitiFi crypto is back in the green, having jumped over 60% in the last month. Each token is currently selling for $12.65, which we believe is a huge discount considering $TRUMP&#8217;s price prediction. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Building the First-Ever L2 on Solana Even with growing network activity on Solana, this meme coin-friendly blockchain has struggled to realize its full potential due to unresolved congestion and scalability issues. It all started when the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on Solana brought in a flurry of new investors and essentially overloaded the network. Solaxy ($SOLX) will address these issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. According to its whitepaper, $SOLX will offload transactions from Solana&#8217;s mainnet and process them on a sidechain instead. This will reduce the burden on Solana and consequently make it quicker. Furthermore, Solaxy will also make Solana more affordable by processing transactions in batches instead of one by one. Solana is already among the cheapest blockchains, meaning Solaxy will work on Solana&#8217;s weaknesses and enhance its strengths. Finally, Solaxy is also easily among the best crypto presales of 2025, having raised over $36M at the time of writing. One $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001727, and here&#8217;s how¬†to¬†buy¬†it. 4. ai16z ($AI16Z) ‚Äì First-Ever Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents As one of the best AI agent coins, the ai16z ($AI16Z) project is out there doing the unthinkable. It&#8217;s the first-ever venture capital firm to incorporate AI agents, who will gather actionable data, study market sentiments, and even execute trades both on-chain and off-chain. ai16z has nearly $350M in market capitalization, so a lot of money is flowing into the &#8216;future of venture capital firms.&#8217; $AI16Z is up over 120% in the last month or so, and it&#8217;s currently trading at $0.3117. This penny crypto is now agonizingly close to the $0.39 resistance level, a break that could see the token climb to new highs. DYOR Before Investing in the Next Crypto to Explode With Bitcoin looking like a million dollars (some would say literally, too), low-cap coins like BTC Bull Token and Solaxy offer potentially once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities. $BTCBULL, for instance, is expected to jump 380% by 2026, whereas $SOLX 11,487% by 2030! Despite their mind-blowing potential, remember that the crypto market doesn&#8217;t guarantee any returns. It&#8217;s highly volatile and unpredictable, and you must, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn&#8217;t disrupt your sleep.",0.2,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T01:45:00.862755+00:00,

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

Until then, consolidation and caution dominate the short-term outlook. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.04,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T01:45:00.862755+00:00,

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Bitcoin,"Ticking Clock To $200K: Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Explosion. Bitcoin hovered around $102,600 today after briefly touching $105,000. The dip didn‚Äôt shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there‚Äôs a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‚Äëdoor government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21‚ÄØmillion coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12‚ÄØmonths. Based on reports, that‚Äôs more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can‚Äôt keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17‚ÄØbillion in seized or held Bitcoin. There‚Äôs even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460‚ÄØmillion for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin‚Äôs big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It‚Äôs not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading‚Äôs Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July‚ÄØ2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That‚Äôs a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear. If ETF demand stays strong and big holders keep buying, Bitcoin may well break past its old highs. For now, investors will keep one eye on short‚Äëterm swings and another on that $200,000 milestone.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators. These include a breakout with substantial trading volume, an RSI reading above 70 on the weekly chart, and a weekly close above the upper Bollinger Band.¬† Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 At the moment, however, the Bitcoin CME Futures chart has failed to move past 70 on the daily RSI twice, and trading volume is in decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading volume of Bitcoin is $44.33 billion in the past 24 hours, a 11.40% reduction from the previous 24 hours. These are early warning signs that a breakout attempt may lack the strength needed for sustainability. Nonetheless, the conditions are still very mixed and starting to lean more bullish than bearish. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,352, down by 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T02:45:00.940483+00:00,

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived‚ÄîHere‚Äôs The Next Price Target. Dogecoin‚Äôs rally of more than 78% in the last 38 days appears to be more than a fleeting spark, according to two independent studies published on X by chartists Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) and TSG (@tsg0x). Both analysts point to classical continuation structures that remain intact after DOGE peaked at $0.2597 on Sunday. While profit-taking has set in, they agree that the next objective lies in the mid-$0.30s. Bluntz‚Äô twelve-hour Binance chart maps out an almost textbook inverse head-and-shoulders that evolved in late-February and was confirmed in early May. The left shoulder was stamped out in mid-March around $0.142, the head was carved at ~$0.129 in the first week of April, and the right shoulder completed at the start of May at $0.164. A descending neckline that had capped price since over the past two months intersected around $0.20; that barrier gave way last week on the heaviest twelve-hour volume cluster since February of 2025 so far, a key confirmation that the breakout is powered by real participation rather than thin-order-book volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart ‚ÄòLooks Perfect‚Äô: Analyst Targets $1.10‚Äì$1.25 Zone Subsequent candles carried DOGE almost to $0.26 before a modest pullback to $0.217 set in. Momentum remains constructive: the RSI, which briefly tagged the oversold area on the breakout, has cooled to the low-60s, suggesting that overbought conditions have been reset without surrendering bullish structure. The measured-move rule for an inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äîneckline to head depth of roughly eight cents‚Äîprojects an initial destination in the $0.26-$0.28 region, in line with the hand-drawn arrow on Bluntz‚Äô chart that shoots into the low-$0.30s. TSG zooms into the four-hour timeframe and observes the same impulse consolidating within a descending parallel channel spanning $0.22‚Äì$0.26, a classic bull flag. On a breakout, he assigns a precise target of $0.32928. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What 3 Leading Analysts Are Watching He buttresses this outlook with a time projection, an arrow that anticipates the next decisive move within the coming days. If the flag fails, invalidation arrives on a four-hour close beneath the lower channel boundary near $0.20; below that, a cyan demand block between roughly $0.16 and $0.21 aligns with the rising trend-line that has underpinned price action since early April, offering bulls a secondary zone to reload. Taken together, the two studies sketch an aligned roadmap. If Dogecoin holds above the $0.20 area, the next price target could be the $0.32 region. At press time, Dogecoin changed hands near $0.228, hovering near the breakout line of the descending trend channel which originated in December last year and dominated price actions since then. Notably, the midline of this channel is also situated just below $0.20, reinforcing the importance of this level for a continuation of the bullish impulse.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC trades at $101,852, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"Ticking Clock To $200K: Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Explosion. Bitcoin hovered around $102,600 today after briefly touching $105,000. The dip didn‚Äôt shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there‚Äôs a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‚Äëdoor government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21‚ÄØmillion coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12‚ÄØmonths. Based on reports, that‚Äôs more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can‚Äôt keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17‚ÄØbillion in seized or held Bitcoin. There‚Äôs even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460‚ÄØmillion for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin‚Äôs big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It‚Äôs not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading‚Äôs Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July‚ÄØ2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That‚Äôs a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators. These include a breakout with substantial trading volume, an RSI reading above 70 on the weekly chart, and a weekly close above the upper Bollinger Band.¬† Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 At the moment, however, the Bitcoin CME Futures chart has failed to move past 70 on the daily RSI twice, and trading volume is in decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading volume of Bitcoin is $44.33 billion in the past 24 hours, a 11.40% reduction from the previous 24 hours. These are early warning signs that a breakout attempt may lack the strength needed for sustainability. Nonetheless, the conditions are still very mixed and starting to lean more bullish than bearish. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,352, down by 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC trades at $101,852, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"Ticking Clock To $200K: Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Explosion. Bitcoin hovered around $102,600 today after briefly touching $105,000. The dip didn‚Äôt shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there‚Äôs a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‚Äëdoor government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21‚ÄØmillion coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12‚ÄØmonths. Based on reports, that‚Äôs more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can‚Äôt keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17‚ÄØbillion in seized or held Bitcoin. There‚Äôs even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460‚ÄØmillion for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin‚Äôs big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It‚Äôs not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading‚Äôs Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July‚ÄØ2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That‚Äôs a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators. These include a breakout with substantial trading volume, an RSI reading above 70 on the weekly chart, and a weekly close above the upper Bollinger Band.¬† Related Reading: ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô Coming For Bitcoin? Why BTC Will Clear $110,000 At the moment, however, the Bitcoin CME Futures chart has failed to move past 70 on the daily RSI twice, and trading volume is in decline. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading volume of Bitcoin is $44.33 billion in the past 24 hours, a 11.40% reduction from the previous 24 hours. These are early warning signs that a breakout attempt may lack the strength needed for sustainability. Nonetheless, the conditions are still very mixed and starting to lean more bullish than bearish. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $102,352, down by 1.31% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up. XRP has re-entered a pivotal trading range against Bitcoin (BTC), stirring up excitement as technical signals suggest a potential breakout. This move is reinforcing its bullish position, highlighting three major price targets that could confirm a larger macro rally.¬† XRP Sets Sights On Key Targets Against Bitcoin After months of consolidation, the XRP/BTC trading pair is now back inside a critical triangle formation, which market expert Egrag Crypto has identified as a key price range to watch for potential breakout or breakdown moves. The analyst shared a short-term XRP/BTC chart on X (formerly Twitter), explaining how important this price range is for the trading pair to hit new bullish targets and reach even larger goals.¬† Related Reading: XRP Analyst Highlights Ultimate Targets And Selling Strategy As XRP Price Rebounds This triangle structure, dating back years, acts as a roadmap for XRP/BTC‚Äôs potential breakout, but only if it successfully flips certain levels into support. The first major target highlighted by Egrag Crypto is $0.000003033, which represents the upper boundary of the triangle. A decisive breakout above this level would signal a structural shift, confirming a possible bullish breakout from the narrowing wedge.¬† The analyst&#8217;s second key target is $0.00003430, the local high from XRP/BTC&#8217;s last rally. This price level is crucial for momentum validation, as flipping this into support with strong volume would build strong confidence in the next upward move and show confirmation that it can hold above it. The third and most critical target the XRP/BTC pair is expected to reach is $0.00004300, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.0 level and XRP/BTC‚Äôs previous cycle high. A move beyond this level suggests the beginning of a macro rally, unlocking access to higher Fibonacci extension levels, including:¬† 1.272 Fib ($0.00007244) 1.414 Fib ($0.00009546) 1.618 Fib ($0.00014191) 1.888 Fib ($0.00030000) The Altcoin Must Hold Support Or Risk Macro Breakdown While Egrag Crypto‚Äôs breakout targets paint an optimistic picture, the XRP/BTC LTC analysis comes with a stark warning of a potential crash. The analyst has raised alarm bells, warning not to lose the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002032.¬† Related Reading: XRP Price To Break Out Of Consolidation: The Next Moonshot That Will Lead To $3 This support range acts as the last kind of defense for XRP/BTC‚Äôs bullish market structure. The analyst goes as far as to say, ‚ÄúLose an arm, but don‚Äôt lose this range,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of maintaining this level. He further predicts that if the pair drops below this support level, it could see a decline to as low as $0.00000611. At the time of the analysis, XRP/BTC was trading at approximately $0.00002516, showing early signs of recovery after dipping below the triangle range. If bulls can defend this level and hold on to their upward momentum, the path toward flipping resistance levels into support becomes potentially clearer.¬† Egrag Crypto has also outlined potential price projections for the XRP based on the bullish scenario where the XRP/BTC pair reaches several upper Fibonacci levels and Bitcoin rallies to key milestones.¬† Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.07,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T04:45:00.903101+00:00,

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch. After several days of intense buying pressure and strong bullish momentum, Ethereum has finally paused its rally, finding resistance around the $2,740 mark. The move comes after ETH effortlessly cleared key resistance levels at $2,000 and $2,200, marking one of its strongest short-term performances in months. As excitement builds across the broader crypto market, Ethereum‚Äôs next move could define the strength and sustainability of this breakout. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal With price now stalling, analysts believe a period of consolidation is likely‚Äîand perhaps even necessary‚Äîbefore the next leg higher. Top analyst Daan shared a technical view suggesting that the $2,400 level will be crucial in the coming days. He believes it makes sense to retest that local support, which would provide a healthier structure for further upside. However, Daan also notes a cautionary signal: extremely high levels of Open Interest across the ETH derivatives market. He‚Äôs currently avoiding long positions until some of that leverage is flushed out, reducing the risk of a sharper pullback. For now, Ethereum bulls must hold above $2,400 to confirm strength and keep the uptrend intact, while traders await cleaner conditions for potential reentry. Ethereum‚Äôs Surge Faces a Crucial Retest Around $2.4K Ethereum has surged more than 50% since last week, reclaiming momentum after months of heavy selling pressure. ETH is showing sustained strength for the first time since late December, fueling optimism that the broader altcoin market could be next. Many analysts are calling for an altseason, and Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is seen as a potential catalyst for a larger move across altcoins that have severely underperformed in recent years. However, after such a sharp move, a period of consolidation or correction wouldn‚Äôt be unusual‚Äîand could even be healthy. According to Daan, the $2,400 level will be a key support zone to watch. He believes it makes sense for price to test this area before further continuation. Daan currently has no interest in entering long positions until some of the billions in Open Interest are flushed from the system. How Ethereum reacts around $2.4K will likely set the tone for the next phase. If ETH sweeps $2.4K and quickly bounces, Daan expects a local range to form between $2.4K and $2.7K. However, if price loses that level decisively, the next major support lies at $2.1K. A slow bleed into that zone could signal weakness, while a quick flush might present a short-lived buying opportunity. Despite short-term risks, Daan notes that even a pullback to $2.1K would still leave ETH up roughly 20% from the prior week. In his view, the larger trading range for now is between $2.1K and $2.8K‚Äîa zone that could define Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend if bulls can hold key levels and regain momentum. For now, the rally is alive, but the next test will be critical. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Price Consolidation Taking Place Amid Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,565, following a sharp retracement from its recent local high near $2,740. After a powerful rally that pushed ETH above both the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA), the price is now consolidating just below the 200-day SMA at $2,702.93. This level has acted as resistance over the last few sessions, capping Ethereum‚Äôs attempt to continue its upward momentum. Volume has declined slightly, reflecting market indecision after last week‚Äôs breakout. If bulls can defend the 200-day EMA near $2,437 and maintain higher lows above $2,500, the structure would remain bullish. However, a failure to hold these levels could lead to a deeper pullback, with $2,400 and $2,200 as potential supports. The recent price action suggests Ethereum is forming a short-term range between $2,400 and $2,700, which could persist until a clear breakout above the 200-day SMA. Holding above $2,500 is crucial to maintaining bullish momentum, especially as the altcoin market eyes further gains.

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency.

News,Bitcoin,"Ticking Clock To $200K: Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Explosion. Bitcoin hovered around $102,600 today after briefly touching $105,000. The dip didn‚Äôt shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there‚Äôs a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‚Äëdoor government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21‚ÄØmillion coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12‚ÄØmonths. Based on reports, that‚Äôs more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can‚Äôt keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17‚ÄØbillion in seized or held Bitcoin. There‚Äôs even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460‚ÄØmillion for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin‚Äôs big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It‚Äôs not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading‚Äôs Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July‚ÄØ2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That‚Äôs a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Turning Bullish Or Bearish? Crypto Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch. Bitcoin&#8217;s price action in the past 24 hours has seen it slowly retracing from the $104,000 zone it started the week at. This range has become particularly significant as Bitcoin continues to flirt with levels last seen during its recent push toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements over the past two days have tightened, and the candlestick behavior on the weekly chart has led to a doji formation on the weekly candlestick timeframe, an indicator of indecision. Interestingly, a technical analysis from crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino has highlighted critical levels to watch that will determine whether the Bitcoin price is turning bearish or still bullish.¬† Mixed Signals: Why the Current Resistance Zone Is Critical Crypto analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino shared a chart and in-depth breakdown on the social media platform X, pointing to horizontal support and resistance levels as the most important technical indicators in his view. As shown on his Bitcoin weekly chart, the leading cryptocurrency is now pressing against a well-defined resistance zone just below its all-time high, marked clearly in red. The proximity of this level to its all-time high means it could act as a ceiling, making it an important area to watch for either a breakout or a reversal. Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Tony outlines three possible interpretations for the current market structure around the $108,000 resistance level. The bullish case hinges on Bitcoin consolidating under resistance, a pattern often followed by upward continuation. The neutral case is that Bitcoin could be forming a broad trading range, in which case it makes sense to short the market at resistance while buying near support. On the bearish side, the presence of a doji candlestick at this key level may be a sign of fading momentum and an early signal of a price reversal. His trading strategy reflects this uncertainty. He has placed short positions within the red resistance zone, with a stop loss just above the all-time high. At the same time, he has set a stop buy order in the green breakout zone above the all-time high, ready to switch long should the Bitcoin price convincingly break through resistance. Conditions For A Bullish Breakout Are Not Yet Fulfilled Although Tony noted that the broader investment market, including altcoins and the stock market, looks strong, he cautioned that this does not guarantee a bullish breakout for Bitcoin. For confirmation, a bullish breakout must be preceded by aligning various technical indicators.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency.

News,Bitcoin,"Ticking Clock To $200K: Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Explosion. Bitcoin hovered around $102,600 today after briefly touching $105,000. The dip didn‚Äôt shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there‚Äôs a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‚Äëdoor government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21‚ÄØmillion coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12‚ÄØmonths. Based on reports, that‚Äôs more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can‚Äôt keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17‚ÄØbillion in seized or held Bitcoin. There‚Äôs even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460‚ÄØmillion for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin‚Äôs big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It‚Äôs not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading‚Äôs Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July‚ÄØ2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That‚Äôs a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500.

News,Solana,"Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details. Solana (SOL) is trading around key levels after reaching a local high of $184, struggling to hold support above the $170 zone. This price region is shaping up to be a pivotal battleground, as bulls aim to extend the rally while some analysts warn of an incoming retracement. Optimism remains strong across the market, with altcoins gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, conflicting views persist, with several traders cautioning that Solana may be overheated in the short term following its recent surge. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details Solana Finds Support Above 200-EMA But Faces Resistance Near $181 Solana is currently trading at $170.48 after a sharp pullback from the recent local high near $184. As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Surges 41% As Speculation Grows ‚Äì Over $1B Added In Just One Week Volume remains elevated, suggesting active participation, though a drop in buying interest may signal caution. If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency.

News,Bitcoin,"Ticking Clock To $200K: Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Explosion. Bitcoin hovered around $102,600 today after briefly touching $105,000. The dip didn‚Äôt shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there‚Äôs a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‚Äëdoor government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21‚ÄØmillion coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12‚ÄØmonths. Based on reports, that‚Äôs more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can‚Äôt keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17‚ÄØbillion in seized or held Bitcoin. There‚Äôs even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460‚ÄØmillion for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin‚Äôs big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It‚Äôs not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading‚Äôs Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July‚ÄØ2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That‚Äôs a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Supporting the bullish narrative, new data from Glassnode shows that Solana may be undergoing a trend reversal. After months of realized cap outflows, SOL‚Äôs 30-day capital inflows have turned positive, currently growing at a steady rate of 4‚Äì5%, a pace similar to that of XRP. This uptick in capital inflow indicates renewed demand entering the ecosystem, hinting that investors may be positioning for further upside. As the broader crypto market heats up, Solana‚Äôs ability to stay above the $170 level will be crucial in determining short-term direction. A confirmed hold could pave the way for a push toward new highs, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper retrace. Renewed Demand And Key Resistance Define Next Move Solana is currently trading above a critical demand zone, showing strength as it holds firmly above the $170 level. However, to confirm the continuation of a sustained bullish rally, SOL must break and close decisively above the $185 resistance level. This region has acted as a strong ceiling in recent price action, and reclaiming it would likely unlock the momentum needed for further gains. The current rally across the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has fueled optimism that a larger bullish phase may be underway. For Solana, this could mark the start of a powerful trend reversal after months of volatility and uncertainty. Importantly, on-chain data supports this bullish case. According to Glassnode, Solana has reversed its negative realized cap flows, with its 30-day capital inflows now back in positive territory. These inflows are growing at a rate of approximately 4‚Äì5%, comparable to what is currently being observed in XRP. This shift signals a return of investor confidence and renewed demand within the Solana ecosystem. Such metrics are critical, as they reflect actual capital commitments rather than just speculative sentiment. If momentum continues and SOL reclaims the $185 level, it could trigger an aggressive breakout and lead the altcoin sector higher. The next few days will be crucial for Solana. Holding above support while attempting to break resistance could define the structure of the next major move. A successful push higher would support the idea that Solana is not only recovering but potentially leading the next phase of altcoin expansion. Traders and investors alike are watching closely as this key test unfolds.

As shown on the chart, the price briefly pushed above both the 200-day EMA ($162.21) and SMA ($181.16), two key technical indicators closely watched by traders. This move signaled strength but was quickly met with selling pressure just below a significant resistance zone near the $185 level ‚Äî the same region where multiple failed attempts have occurred in the past. Despite the recent 3.5% daily drop, the price action remains bullish as long as SOL holds above the 200EMA. The higher low structure remains intact, and the recent retrace could be viewed as a healthy consolidation if bulls defend this range. A sustained move above the 200SMA at $181.16 would likely trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum and open the door for a push toward the $200-$220 area.

If the $162 zone fails to hold, a deeper retrace toward $150 is possible. For now, all eyes are on whether SOL can reclaim $181 with strength and set the stage for a sustained breakout.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon?

Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC trades at $101,852, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

News,Bitcoin,"Ticking Clock To $200K: Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Explosion. Bitcoin hovered around $102,600 today after briefly touching $105,000. The dip didn‚Äôt shake everyone. Many still bet on a major rally. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in an interview yesterday, there‚Äôs a path for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by December 31. He points to growing ETF inflows, more corporate buying, and what he sees as open‚Äëdoor government policies. Related Reading: Dogecoin‚Äôs $1 Dream: Analyst Reveals When It Could Finally Happen Supply And Demand Gap Widens Supply is fixed at 21‚ÄØmillion coins, with about 165,000 new Bitcoin mined each year. ETF funds, on the other hand, snapped up roughly 500,000 Bitcoin over the past 12‚ÄØmonths. Based on reports, that‚Äôs more than three times the annual supply. When fresh coins can‚Äôt keep pace with big buyers, prices get pushed up. Corporate And Government Holding Rises Companies such as Strategy continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Based on reports, the US government already has over $17‚ÄØbillion in seized or held Bitcoin. There‚Äôs even talk of an executive order to source more without tapping taxpayers. Some say that could mean swapping gold reserves or selling other crypto assets. Abroad, Abu Dhabi reportedly paid $460‚ÄØmillion for new Bitcoin, and at least 10 other governments may follow this year. Timing And Economic Volatility Hougan says Bitcoin‚Äôs big run was delayed by a spell of economic turbulence. Stocks have slid, and risk assets all felt the heat. He argues that once volatility eases, Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum will kick back in. It makes sense on paper. Yet markets can surprise. A sudden move by the Federal Reserve or a shift in borrowing costs might slow the climb again. Other Analyst Forecasts Align It‚Äôs not just Bitwise calling for $200,000. Bernstein senior analyst Gautam Chhugani has that number on his radar for 2025. And Intuit Trading‚Äôs Blockchaindaily team redrew a trendline after Bitcoin bottomed at $74,000 in April. Their line now points to $200,000 by July‚ÄØ2025. To go from $102,600 to $200,000, Bitcoin needs to climb about 95%. That‚Äôs a big leap, even if history shows crypto can move fast. Related Reading: Avalanche Rumbles 21% Amid Record-Breaking Address Activity Looking Ahead With Caution Meanwhile, there are clear risks on the horizon. Changes in tax rules, new trading fees, or a surprise rate hike could push prices down. Still, many believe those hurdles will clear. If ETF demand stays strong and big holders keep buying, Bitcoin may well break past its old highs. For now, investors will keep one eye on short‚Äëterm swings and another on that $200,000 milestone.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency.

There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $103,950 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $105,000 resistance. Bitcoin Price Aims Higher Bitcoin price started a fresh increase from the $101,500 support zone. BTC formed a base and was able to clear the $102,500 resistance zone. The bulls even pushed the price above $103,200. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $104,980 swing high to the $101,441 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $103,950 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $103,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $104,150 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $104,980 swing high to the $101,441 low. The first key resistance is near the $105,000 level. The next key resistance could be $105,500. A close above the $105,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $106,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $108,000 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $104,200 resistance zone, it could start another correction in the short term. Immediate support on the downside is near the $103,200 level and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The first major support is near the $102,500 level.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $102,300, up over 3% in the last seven days.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren‚Äôt Selling ‚Äì More Upside Ahead?. Fresh on-chain data suggests that despite Bitcoin (BTC) trading close to its all-time high (ATH), long-term holders (LTHs) are not offloading their holdings. Instead, these investors are continuing to accumulate the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, signaling their confidence in further price gains in the coming weeks. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Not Selling Yet According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, profit-taking among long-term holders remains relatively low, even as BTC trades near its ATH. Historically, profit-taking activity tends to increase significantly when Bitcoin approaches its previous high, as many investors look to lock in gains. However, that has not been the case in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market ‚Äì New ATH Soon? The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin consolidating near ATH levels typically results in significant profit realization by market participants. Yet, current data reveals that LTH &#8211; those who have held BTC for more than 150 days &#8211; have not begun large-scale profit-taking. Specifically, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric is heading downwards even when BTC continues to steadily surge toward a new ATH around $109,000. The analyst explains: This decline suggests that long-term holders have not yet engaged in notable profit-taking. Instead, they appear to be accumulating, signaling confidence in higher price targets and anticipating new all-time highs. In essence, the ongoing BTC consolidation phase seems to be driven more by short-term holders (STHs) and retail traders. Historically, these investor segments are more reactive to price swings, responding swiftly to both upward and downward movements. The analyst further stated that Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, the next upward movement could propel BTC to new record highs in the mid-term. Analysis from fellow CryptoQuant contributor BlitzzTrading supports this outlook. BlitzzTrading observed that BTC whales &#8211; wallets holding significant Bitcoin holdings &#8211; have taken much less profit compared to previous bull runs.¬† This behavior suggests a long-term investment mindset among whales, aligning them more closely with LTHs than retail traders or short-term speculators. It‚Äôs fair to say that BTC whales are typically long-term investors, often holding their positions through market cycles, unlike smaller holders who tend to trade more frequently. BTC May Follow Gold‚Äôs Historic Price Action Interestingly, comparisons are now being drawn between Bitcoin and gold. Gold has seen impressive gains over the past two years, rising from around $1,800 per ounce in mid-2023 to about $3,200 per ounce today &#8211; an increase of nearly 75%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits Aggressively ‚Äì Signs Of A Local Top? Crypto analyst Cryptollica recently remarked that BTC is likely to follow gold‚Äôs footsteps and experience similar extraordinary gains in 2025. The analyst forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $155,000 this year. Similarly, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is pointing toward the continuation of bullish momentum for the apex cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC trades at $101,852, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Holding Strong ‚Äî Signs Point to a New Upside Breakout. Ethereum price corrected gains and tested the $2,500 zone. ETH is now again rising and might soon aim for a move above the $2,600 zone. Ethereum started a correction from the $2,740 zone and tested $2,500. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,600 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price struggled to clear the $2,740 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. The price even spiked below the $2,520 level, but the bulls were active near the $2,500 zone. The price found support near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,415 swing low to the $2,735 high. Ether is again rising from the $2,500 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,575 level. There is also a key declining channel or a possible bullish flag forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,735 resistance. An upside break above the $2,735 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,525 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,420 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

News,Bitcoin,"This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet. On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Binary CDD is yet to reach the same peak as during the last few tops in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. 30-Day MA Of Bitcoin Binary CDD Is Currently Sitting Around 0.6 In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Binary CDD for Bitcoin. The &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of &#8216;coin days&#8217; being reset across the network. A coin day is a quantity that one token of the cryptocurrency accumulates after having stayed dormant on the blockchain for one day. When a coin that was previously still for some number of days is moved across the network, its coin days counter naturally resets back to zero, and the coin days that it had accumulated are said to be &#8216;destroyed.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Whenever the CDD registers a large spike, it&#8217;s a sign that dormant hands on the network are on the move. Generally, the long-term holders only break their silence when they plan to sell, so this kind of trend can prove to be bearish for BTC. The Binary CDD, the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, makes it easier to identify whether the current HODLer transaction activity is significant or not when compared to the past. As its name already suggests, this metric can take on two values: 0 and 1. The Binary CDD is equal to 0 when the CDD is below the historical average and 1 when it&#8217;s above. Note that since the indicator is making a historical comparison, it adds another weighting factor to the CDD: an adjustment with respect to the total circulating supply at the time. This is done because the asset&#8217;s supply is going up with time. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Binary CDD over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin Binary CDD has been following an upward trajectory recently, implying long-term holders are potentially becoming more active. The increase in the indicator has come as BTC has started on a fresh rally that has taken its price near the all-time high (ATH). While the long-term holders tend to be resolute entities, they do still come out to take their profits during significant runs. As such, the recent trend in the 30-day MA of the Binary CDD may not be too surprising. Following the latest continuation to the rise, the metric has hit the 0.60 mark (if the fact that this value is different from the 0 and 1 of the Binary CDD is confusing, consider that this is just an average over 30 days, which would almost always be between these two extremes). Related Reading: Where‚Äôs Next Major Dogecoin Resistance? On-Chain Data Points To This As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, this value is still below the 0.80 level that the indicator breached during both the rally highs from last year, as well as during the euphoria phase of the 2021 bull run. Given this pattern, it&#8217;s possible that the current Bitcoin rally could still have room to grow, at least from the perspective of HODLer distribution.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,200, up over 2% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Analysis: What Lies Ahead for ETH on its Way to $3K?. Ethereum is showing signs of short-term exhaustion after a strong impulsive rally. Although the buyers have managed to break through major resistance levels, the price is currently stalling around a key structure and could be at risk of a local top if momentum fades. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart ETH has decisively broken above the [&#8230;]",0.08,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T14:33:04.721707+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $103,200, up over 2% in the last seven days.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Analysis: What Lies Ahead for ETH on its Way to $3K?. Ethereum is showing signs of short-term exhaustion after a strong impulsive rally. Although the buyers have managed to break through major resistance levels, the price is currently stalling around a key structure and could be at risk of a local top if momentum fades. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart ETH has decisively broken above the [&#8230;]",0.08,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T14:44:19.720419+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Could See Short-Term Holder Selloff Around These Levels, Analyst Says. An analyst has explained how Bitcoin could face significant waves of selling pressure from the short-term holders around these price levels. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder MVRV Could Flag These Levels As Important In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The MVRV Ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The former represents the value currently held by the investors as a whole, while the latter that initially invested by them. As such, this ratio tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. Related Reading: This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Run Signal Hasn‚Äôt Shown Up Yet When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average investor on the chain is holding a net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the holders. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific part of the market is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this cohort tend not to be too resolute, so they often react to market happenings. In particular, whenever the profit held by them gets too high, a mass selloff from them can become probable, as they look to realize their gains. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio fell under the 1 mark earlier in the year as the asset&#8217;s price declined below the average cost basis of the group. With the latest recovery rally, the cryptocurrency has managed to break back above the line, putting STHs back into gains. So far, the MVRV Ratio has only reached the 1.09 mark, which isn&#8217;t too high when compared to past rallies. As such, it&#8217;s possible that the STHs may not be tempted to realize profits en masse just yet. In the chart, Adler Jr has highlighted two levels where profitability is high enough that significant selling pressure can indeed become likely to arise from this cohort: the 1.25 and 1.35 STH MVRV Ratios. At present, the former is situated at $118,000 and the latter at $128,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? It now remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will rally high enough to retest these levels‚Äîand if it does, whether the STH selloff will act as resistance.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Analysis: What Lies Ahead for ETH on its Way to $3K?. Ethereum is showing signs of short-term exhaustion after a strong impulsive rally. Although the buyers have managed to break through major resistance levels, the price is currently stalling around a key structure and could be at risk of a local top if momentum fades. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart ETH has decisively broken above the [&#8230;]",0.08,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-16T14:52:58.365273+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Bitcoin,"‚ÄòWhat If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?‚Äô Says Dave Portnoy. Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, used his debut appearance at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2025 to train the conference spotlight XRP. Speaking on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre mainstage, Portnoy acknowledged that he bought the token for one reason only: fear of missing out. Joined on-stage by media strategist Sam Ewan, Portnoy opened with light banter about Toronto pizza‚Äî‚ÄúNorth of Brooklyn still is, I would say, my favorite,‚Äù he insisted, giving ‚Äúshout-out Bill the Greek, who‚Äôs like my chaperone for Toronto‚Äù‚Äîbefore turning to the market that drew thousands to Consensus. Pressed on whether the current cycle is dominated by so-called meme coins, Portnoy cut to the chase. ‚ÄúEven Bitcoin is, frankly, a memecoin,‚Äù he said. The remark set the tone for a discussion that oscillated between portfolio confessions and cultural critique. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up When Ewan tried to pinpoint Portnoy‚Äôs boldest wager, the 47-year-old rattled off winners the way others recall birthdays: Axon stock at roughly $200 (now about $700, he noted), Michigan‚Äôs Rose Bowl triumph, and Scottie Scheffler capturing the Masters. Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that? What if that‚Äôs the next Bitcoin?‚Äù he said, emphasising that his allocation reflects a speculative itch rather than a thesis about Ripple‚Äôs technology or tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs FOMO. It‚Äôs not like I have some grand belief in it.‚Äù In perhaps the panel‚Äôs most revealing anecdote, Portnoy traced his fraught history with Bitcoin to a chance encounter: ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin the first time for around $10,000 ‚Ä¶ the Winklevoss twins were staying next door to me at a hotel and they came and explained what Bitcoin was. It was the dumbest explanation I‚Äôd ever heard, and I sold it all right there.‚Äù The forfeited position‚Äî‚Äúabout $2 million‚Äù‚Äîwould have dwarfed every other win in his career, he conceded, underscoring the emotional swing between conviction and capitulation that defines many retail journeys through crypto‚Äôs boom-and-bust cycles.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Bitcoin,"‚ÄòWhat If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?‚Äô Says Dave Portnoy. Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, used his debut appearance at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2025 to train the conference spotlight XRP. Speaking on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre mainstage, Portnoy acknowledged that he bought the token for one reason only: fear of missing out. Joined on-stage by media strategist Sam Ewan, Portnoy opened with light banter about Toronto pizza‚Äî‚ÄúNorth of Brooklyn still is, I would say, my favorite,‚Äù he insisted, giving ‚Äúshout-out Bill the Greek, who‚Äôs like my chaperone for Toronto‚Äù‚Äîbefore turning to the market that drew thousands to Consensus. Pressed on whether the current cycle is dominated by so-called meme coins, Portnoy cut to the chase. ‚ÄúEven Bitcoin is, frankly, a memecoin,‚Äù he said. The remark set the tone for a discussion that oscillated between portfolio confessions and cultural critique. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up When Ewan tried to pinpoint Portnoy‚Äôs boldest wager, the 47-year-old rattled off winners the way others recall birthdays: Axon stock at roughly $200 (now about $700, he noted), Michigan‚Äôs Rose Bowl triumph, and Scottie Scheffler capturing the Masters. Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that? What if that‚Äôs the next Bitcoin?‚Äù he said, emphasising that his allocation reflects a speculative itch rather than a thesis about Ripple‚Äôs technology or tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs FOMO. It‚Äôs not like I have some grand belief in it.‚Äù In perhaps the panel‚Äôs most revealing anecdote, Portnoy traced his fraught history with Bitcoin to a chance encounter: ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin the first time for around $10,000 ‚Ä¶ the Winklevoss twins were staying next door to me at a hotel and they came and explained what Bitcoin was. It was the dumbest explanation I‚Äôd ever heard, and I sold it all right there.‚Äù The forfeited position‚Äî‚Äúabout $2 million‚Äù‚Äîwould have dwarfed every other win in his career, he conceded, underscoring the emotional swing between conviction and capitulation that defines many retail journeys through crypto‚Äôs boom-and-bust cycles.

Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure.

Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Bitcoin,"‚ÄòWhat If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?‚Äô Says Dave Portnoy. Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, used his debut appearance at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2025 to train the conference spotlight XRP. Speaking on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre mainstage, Portnoy acknowledged that he bought the token for one reason only: fear of missing out. Joined on-stage by media strategist Sam Ewan, Portnoy opened with light banter about Toronto pizza‚Äî‚ÄúNorth of Brooklyn still is, I would say, my favorite,‚Äù he insisted, giving ‚Äúshout-out Bill the Greek, who‚Äôs like my chaperone for Toronto‚Äù‚Äîbefore turning to the market that drew thousands to Consensus. Pressed on whether the current cycle is dominated by so-called meme coins, Portnoy cut to the chase. ‚ÄúEven Bitcoin is, frankly, a memecoin,‚Äù he said. The remark set the tone for a discussion that oscillated between portfolio confessions and cultural critique. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up When Ewan tried to pinpoint Portnoy‚Äôs boldest wager, the 47-year-old rattled off winners the way others recall birthdays: Axon stock at roughly $200 (now about $700, he noted), Michigan‚Äôs Rose Bowl triumph, and Scottie Scheffler capturing the Masters. Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that?

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure.

Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that?

It‚Äôs not like I have some grand belief in it.‚Äù In perhaps the panel‚Äôs most revealing anecdote, Portnoy traced his fraught history with Bitcoin to a chance encounter: ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin the first time for around $10,000 ‚Ä¶ the Winklevoss twins were staying next door to me at a hotel and they came and explained what Bitcoin was. It was the dumbest explanation I‚Äôd ever heard, and I sold it all right there.‚Äù The forfeited position‚Äî‚Äúabout $2 million‚Äù‚Äîwould have dwarfed every other win in his career, he conceded, underscoring the emotional swing between conviction and capitulation that defines many retail journeys through crypto‚Äôs boom-and-bust cycles.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Bitcoin,"‚ÄòWhat If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?‚Äô Says Dave Portnoy. Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, used his debut appearance at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2025 to train the conference spotlight XRP. Speaking on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre mainstage, Portnoy acknowledged that he bought the token for one reason only: fear of missing out. Joined on-stage by media strategist Sam Ewan, Portnoy opened with light banter about Toronto pizza‚Äî‚ÄúNorth of Brooklyn still is, I would say, my favorite,‚Äù he insisted, giving ‚Äúshout-out Bill the Greek, who‚Äôs like my chaperone for Toronto‚Äù‚Äîbefore turning to the market that drew thousands to Consensus. Pressed on whether the current cycle is dominated by so-called meme coins, Portnoy cut to the chase. ‚ÄúEven Bitcoin is, frankly, a memecoin,‚Äù he said. The remark set the tone for a discussion that oscillated between portfolio confessions and cultural critique. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up When Ewan tried to pinpoint Portnoy‚Äôs boldest wager, the 47-year-old rattled off winners the way others recall birthdays: Axon stock at roughly $200 (now about $700, he noted), Michigan‚Äôs Rose Bowl triumph, and Scottie Scheffler capturing the Masters. Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that? What if that‚Äôs the next Bitcoin?‚Äù he said, emphasising that his allocation reflects a speculative itch rather than a thesis about Ripple‚Äôs technology or tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs FOMO. It‚Äôs not like I have some grand belief in it.‚Äù In perhaps the panel‚Äôs most revealing anecdote, Portnoy traced his fraught history with Bitcoin to a chance encounter: ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin the first time for around $10,000 ‚Ä¶ the Winklevoss twins were staying next door to me at a hotel and they came and explained what Bitcoin was. It was the dumbest explanation I‚Äôd ever heard, and I sold it all right there.‚Äù The forfeited position‚Äî‚Äúabout $2 million‚Äù‚Äîwould have dwarfed every other win in his career, he conceded, underscoring the emotional swing between conviction and capitulation that defines many retail journeys through crypto‚Äôs boom-and-bust cycles.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Bitcoin,"‚ÄòWhat If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?‚Äô Says Dave Portnoy. Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, used his debut appearance at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2025 to train the conference spotlight XRP. Speaking on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre mainstage, Portnoy acknowledged that he bought the token for one reason only: fear of missing out. Joined on-stage by media strategist Sam Ewan, Portnoy opened with light banter about Toronto pizza‚Äî‚ÄúNorth of Brooklyn still is, I would say, my favorite,‚Äù he insisted, giving ‚Äúshout-out Bill the Greek, who‚Äôs like my chaperone for Toronto‚Äù‚Äîbefore turning to the market that drew thousands to Consensus. Pressed on whether the current cycle is dominated by so-called meme coins, Portnoy cut to the chase. ‚ÄúEven Bitcoin is, frankly, a memecoin,‚Äù he said. The remark set the tone for a discussion that oscillated between portfolio confessions and cultural critique. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up When Ewan tried to pinpoint Portnoy‚Äôs boldest wager, the 47-year-old rattled off winners the way others recall birthdays: Axon stock at roughly $200 (now about $700, he noted), Michigan‚Äôs Rose Bowl triumph, and Scottie Scheffler capturing the Masters. Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that? What if that‚Äôs the next Bitcoin?‚Äù he said, emphasising that his allocation reflects a speculative itch rather than a thesis about Ripple‚Äôs technology or tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs FOMO. It‚Äôs not like I have some grand belief in it.‚Äù In perhaps the panel‚Äôs most revealing anecdote, Portnoy traced his fraught history with Bitcoin to a chance encounter: ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin the first time for around $10,000 ‚Ä¶ the Winklevoss twins were staying next door to me at a hotel and they came and explained what Bitcoin was. It was the dumbest explanation I‚Äôd ever heard, and I sold it all right there.‚Äù The forfeited position‚Äî‚Äúabout $2 million‚Äù‚Äîwould have dwarfed every other win in his career, he conceded, underscoring the emotional swing between conviction and capitulation that defines many retail journeys through crypto‚Äôs boom-and-bust cycles.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

2025-05-16T15:54:32.749461+00:00,Bitcoin,News,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

2025-05-16T16:06:09.930439+00:00,Bitcoin,News,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

2025-05-16T16:06:09.930439+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold,

According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action.

This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

2025-05-16T16:27:13.481516+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Breaks Above Key Realized Price Zones‚ÄîWhat It Means for ETH. Ethereum (ETH) experienced a slight price pullback over the past 24 hours, declining by 2.1% to hover slightly above $2,500. Despite this daily decline, ETH has remained at more than 30% over the past week, marking a strong recovery trend from earlier market conditions. The rally follows broad strength across the crypto market, with Ethereum pushing into new price zones that have brought it above several important realized price levels. The price movement from Ethereum prompted one of CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributors, BlitzzTrading, to closely monitor ETH&#8217;s realized price data, particularly how it relates to different wallet cohorts. Related Reading: $1.2B In Ethereum Withdrawn From CEXs ‚Äì Strong Accumulation Signal Understanding Realized Prices Across ETH Wallet Tiers BlitzzTrading highlighted that Ethereum has moved above the average cost basis of most holders, broken down by wallet size. This ‚Äúaverage cost basis,‚Äù or realized price, refers to the average price at which a given cohort of investors acquired their ETH. It is calculated by assessing the aggregate value at which the coins were last moved, providing insight into whether those investors are currently in profit or loss. Tracking these levels can help traders identify potential support zones or areas where profit-taking may occur. According to BlitzzTrading‚Äôs data, holders with balances between 100‚Äì1,000 ETH have a realized price of $2,225, those with 1,000‚Äì10,000 ETH hold at $2,196, and wallets holding between 10,000‚Äì100,000 ETH have an average cost basis of $1,994. Larger wallets, with over 100,000 ETH, have a much lower average cost basis of $1,222. As the current ETH price hovers around $2,500, most of these groups are in profit. However, price corrections to retest these levels, especially after sharp rallies, are common in both bullish and sideways market structures. Profit-Taking by Ethereum Whales Raises Questions About Short-Term Top In a related post, BlitzzTrading explored the behavior of large Ethereum holders, referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù defined as addresses holding over 10,000 ETH. These large investors can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the volume of their trades. The analyst noted that after ETH previously reached the $4,000 mark, whale-driven profit-taking contributed to a drop in price down to $1,300. Monitoring such activity is vital, as it can signal upcoming shifts in trend or potential short-term price ceilings. Related Reading: Ethereum Stakers Enter Profit Zone as Price Climbs Above $2,400 Currently, ETH is once again approaching territory where whales are significantly in profit. If these large holders begin to offload their positions, similar to previous cycles, it may introduce downward pressure. However, if whale wallets continue to hold or accumulate, it may reinforce broader market confidence. Real-time monitoring of whale flows remains a key tool for interpreting Ethereum‚Äôs short-term trajectory. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold,

According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides.

According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone.

A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month.

However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow.

One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

2025-05-16T17:33:40.292313+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Looks Ready To Break Out Of 4-Year Consolidation, Analyst Says Price Will ‚ÄòGo Insane‚Äô. Ethereum is again looking bullish following its gains of over 17% in the last seven days and the break above $2,500. Analysts have provided a positive outlook for the second-largest crypto by market cap, predicting that its price could soon go parabolic after an extended consolidation period.¬† Ethereum Primed To Break Out As Price Goes Parabolic¬† In an X post, crypto analyst Mister Crypto noted that Ethereum has been consolidating for four years and that the longer the consolidation, the bigger the pump. He added that he is extremely bullish, indicating that a breakout was imminent. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could reach a new all-time high (ATH) on this breakout.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Crypto analyst Skyrexio also asserted that Ethereum will go ‚Äúinsane‚Äù soon. In a TradingView analysis, he stated that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is about to finish the uptrend, which can give ETH a second life. The analyst added that the bounce is already happening, although Ethereum‚Äôs price is struggling to break through $2,600.¬† He admitted that Ethereum could experience a small correction in the upcoming week but assured that the final uptrend has been confirmed. Analyzing ETH‚Äôs weekly chart, Skyrexio opined that the crypto is on wave 3 of the Elliott wave structure. The analyst revealed a green dot on the Bullish/Bearish Reversal Bar indicator, which he claimed is a huge confirmation of the bull run.¬† Skyrexio stated that the target for wave 3 is the 1.61 Fibonacci at $6,500. He told market participants to consider the second scenario, when BTC dominance will reach 67% and ETH will retest the low. Whales are actively accumulating ahead of a potential price surge. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that nearly 1 million ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past month.¬† ETH Has Broken Out Of The 3-Year Downtrend In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto revealed that Ethereum has broken out of the 3-year downtrend. He added that from now on, ETH will outperform BTC till the cycle peak.

2025-05-16T17:33:40.292313+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

2025-05-16T17:33:40.292313+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion DOGE In A Month: Fueling Price Surge Speculation. Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA. A deeper pullback to the $0.20‚Äì$0.195 range would still be considered healthy within the broader uptrend, but any close below the 200 SMA would weaken the bullish outlook.

News,Bitcoin,"‚ÄòWhat If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?‚Äô Says Dave Portnoy. Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, used his debut appearance at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2025 to train the conference spotlight XRP. Speaking on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre mainstage, Portnoy acknowledged that he bought the token for one reason only: fear of missing out. Joined on-stage by media strategist Sam Ewan, Portnoy opened with light banter about Toronto pizza‚Äî‚ÄúNorth of Brooklyn still is, I would say, my favorite,‚Äù he insisted, giving ‚Äúshout-out Bill the Greek, who‚Äôs like my chaperone for Toronto‚Äù‚Äîbefore turning to the market that drew thousands to Consensus. Pressed on whether the current cycle is dominated by so-called meme coins, Portnoy cut to the chase. ‚ÄúEven Bitcoin is, frankly, a memecoin,‚Äù he said. The remark set the tone for a discussion that oscillated between portfolio confessions and cultural critique. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up When Ewan tried to pinpoint Portnoy‚Äôs boldest wager, the 47-year-old rattled off winners the way others recall birthdays: Axon stock at roughly $200 (now about $700, he noted), Michigan‚Äôs Rose Bowl triumph, and Scottie Scheffler capturing the Masters. Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that? What if that‚Äôs the next Bitcoin?‚Äù he said, emphasising that his allocation reflects a speculative itch rather than a thesis about Ripple‚Äôs technology or tokenomics. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs FOMO. It‚Äôs not like I have some grand belief in it.‚Äù In perhaps the panel‚Äôs most revealing anecdote, Portnoy traced his fraught history with Bitcoin to a chance encounter: ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin the first time for around $10,000 ‚Ä¶ the Winklevoss twins were staying next door to me at a hotel and they came and explained what Bitcoin was. It was the dumbest explanation I‚Äôd ever heard, and I sold it all right there.‚Äù The forfeited position‚Äî‚Äúabout $2 million‚Äù‚Äîwould have dwarfed every other win in his career, he conceded, underscoring the emotional swing between conviction and capitulation that defines many retail journeys through crypto‚Äôs boom-and-bust cycles.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion DOGE In A Month: Fueling Price Surge Speculation. Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA. A deeper pullback to the $0.20‚Äì$0.195 range would still be considered healthy within the broader uptrend, but any close below the 200 SMA would weaken the bullish outlook.

2025-05-16T17:52:50.166958+00:00,Bitcoin,News,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides.

According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart.

According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action.

At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides.

Ethereum is again looking bullish following its gains of over 17% in the last seven days and the break above $2,500. Analysts have provided a positive outlook for the second-largest crypto by market cap, predicting that its price could soon go parabolic after an extended consolidation period.¬† Ethereum Primed To Break Out As Price Goes Parabolic¬† In an X post, crypto analyst Mister Crypto noted that Ethereum has been consolidating for four years and that the longer the consolidation, the bigger the pump. He added that he is extremely bullish, indicating that a breakout was imminent. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could reach a new all-time high (ATH) on this breakout.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next Crypto analyst Skyrexio also asserted that Ethereum will go ‚Äúinsane‚Äù soon. In a TradingView analysis, he stated that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is about to finish the uptrend, which can give ETH a second life. The analyst added that the bounce is already happening, although Ethereum‚Äôs price is struggling to break through $2,600.¬† He admitted that Ethereum could experience a small correction in the upcoming week but assured that the final uptrend has been confirmed. Analyzing ETH‚Äôs weekly chart, Skyrexio opined that the crypto is on wave 3 of the Elliott wave structure. The analyst revealed a green dot on the Bullish/Bearish Reversal Bar indicator, which he claimed is a huge confirmation of the bull run.¬† Skyrexio stated that the target for wave 3 is the 1.61 Fibonacci at $6,500. He told market participants to consider the second scenario, when BTC dominance will reach 67% and ETH will retest the low. Whales are actively accumulating ahead of a potential price surge. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that nearly 1 million ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past month.¬† ETH Has Broken Out Of The 3-Year Downtrend In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto revealed that Ethereum has broken out of the 3-year downtrend. He added that from now on, ETH will outperform BTC till the cycle peak.

He noted that ETH is looking to pull 2017 vibes, which is another reason he is confident that the crypto can eventually rally to as high as $10,000.

2025-05-16T18:05:16.421639+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

2025-05-16T18:05:16.421639+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion DOGE In A Month: Fueling Price Surge Speculation. Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA. A deeper pullback to the $0.20‚Äì$0.195 range would still be considered healthy within the broader uptrend, but any close below the 200 SMA would weaken the bullish outlook.

News,Bitcoin,"‚ÄòWhat If XRP Is The Next Bitcoin?‚Äô Says Dave Portnoy. Dave Portnoy, the outspoken founder of Barstool Sports, used his debut appearance at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2025 to train the conference spotlight XRP. Speaking on the Metro Toronto Convention Centre mainstage, Portnoy acknowledged that he bought the token for one reason only: fear of missing out. Joined on-stage by media strategist Sam Ewan, Portnoy opened with light banter about Toronto pizza‚Äî‚ÄúNorth of Brooklyn still is, I would say, my favorite,‚Äù he insisted, giving ‚Äúshout-out Bill the Greek, who‚Äôs like my chaperone for Toronto‚Äù‚Äîbefore turning to the market that drew thousands to Consensus. Pressed on whether the current cycle is dominated by so-called meme coins, Portnoy cut to the chase. ‚ÄúEven Bitcoin is, frankly, a memecoin,‚Äù he said. The remark set the tone for a discussion that oscillated between portfolio confessions and cultural critique. Related Reading: XRP Moves Into Key Range Against Bitcoin As 3 Major Targets Show Up When Ewan tried to pinpoint Portnoy‚Äôs boldest wager, the 47-year-old rattled off winners the way others recall birthdays: Axon stock at roughly $200 (now about $700, he noted), Michigan‚Äôs Rose Bowl triumph, and Scottie Scheffler capturing the Masters. Yet he called those victories ‚Äútwo different things‚Äù from the instant, couch-bound gratification of watching a line of green candles. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about it when you place a bet, you see Bitcoin go up, you see XRP go up, and you‚Äôre just sitting on your couch‚Äî‚ÄòI made that money not working.‚Äô That‚Äôs a great feeling,‚Äù he admitted. Why XRP, Not Bitcoin Portnoy‚Äôs self-diagnosed FOMO emerged in sharper relief as the conversation turned to real estate. He recalled smashing his fist on a desk after being outbid on a Miami apartment by ‚Äúa crypto bro‚Äù who ‚Äúheard about Bitcoin when it was, I don‚Äôt know, eight bucks, seven bucks.‚Äù The episode, he said, crystallised the anxiety of missing an asymmetric trade: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slaved for twenty years and he just out-bid me.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Surges Past Neckline‚ÄîAnalyst Projects Rally To $3.57 That same impulse, Portnoy confessed, now drives his position in XRP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äîtwo bucks forty cents or something like that?

It‚Äôs not like I have some grand belief in it.‚Äù In perhaps the panel‚Äôs most revealing anecdote, Portnoy traced his fraught history with Bitcoin to a chance encounter: ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin the first time for around $10,000 ‚Ä¶ the Winklevoss twins were staying next door to me at a hotel and they came and explained what Bitcoin was. It was the dumbest explanation I‚Äôd ever heard, and I sold it all right there.‚Äù The forfeited position‚Äî‚Äúabout $2 million‚Äù‚Äîwould have dwarfed every other win in his career, he conceded, underscoring the emotional swing between conviction and capitulation that defines many retail journeys through crypto‚Äôs boom-and-bust cycles.

News,Bitcoin,"Galaxy CEO Novogratz Sees Imminent Bitcoin Breakout To $130,000. A week of steady closes above the psychologically potent $100,000 mark has sharpened Mike Novogratz‚Äôs conviction that Bitcoin is once again approaching escape velocity. Speaking on the latest ‚ÄúGalaxy Brains‚Äù podcast, the Galaxy Digital founder traced the market‚Äôs arc back to its late-March nadir‚Äî‚ÄúBitcoin went down and kissed right where it broke out: $74,000‚Äù‚Äîand argued that the subsequent recovery has rebuilt the structural bid that drives decisive trend inflections. ‚ÄúBitcoin stops going down, it finds its buyers, and then it starts regaining momentum; and as soon as it gets momentum, momentum begets momentum,‚Äù he told host Alex Thorn. The Key For A New Bitcoin All-Time High That regained momentum, Novogratz contends, has already neutralised the post-tariff risk-off that rattled global assets. Gold ‚Äúroofed‚Äù while Bitcoin ‚Äúsold off,‚Äù yet the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rebound has outpaced every major risk proxy. ETF demand underscores the shift: ‚ÄúNet cumulative flows are at all-time highs,‚Äù noted Galaxy trader Bimnet Abbi in the same episode, adding that retail and corporate treasuries continue to absorb supply. MicroStrategy‚Äôs at-the-market issuance has been ‚Äúbuying at a record pace,‚Äù and fresh entrants‚Äîincluding the ‚ÄúSoftBank-Tether version of MicroStrategy,‚Äù a newly announced ‚ÄúDavid Bailey version,‚Äù and an expanding Japanese version Metaplanet‚Äîare repeating that playbook. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Novogratz sees these structural bids compressing the window between resistance and fresh price discovery. ‚ÄúIt feels right now like if we take out $107,000, we‚Äôre going to be $120,000 &#8211; $130,000,‚Äù he predicted. The level he emphasised‚Äî$107,000‚Äîmarks both the post-ETF closing high and the neckline of March‚Äôs corrective range; a decisive breach would, in his framing, unleash a self-reinforcing scramble for exposure among under-positioned institutions. Macro inputs appear to support that thesis. Equities ‚Äúhave rallied almost 25% from the lows,‚Äù Abbi observed, while retail investors who ‚Äúbought the dip ‚Ä¶ are now sitting in a ton of profits.‚Äù Against that backdrop, Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation to traditional risk has remained elastic, at times trading ‚Äúlike gold‚Äù when monetary hedges caught a bid, and at times outperforming high-beta equities during growth rotations. For Novogratz, that chameleon-like behaviour is evidence that Bitcoin is maturing into ‚Äúa macro asset that is going to be on every desk of every macro trader‚Äù‚Äîa role that, in his view, will eventually see its market capitalisation surpass gold‚Äôs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Even so, he acknowledged the feedback loop that can magnify volatility. Short-term froth‚Äî‚Äúreal sellers ‚Ä¶ that bought at forty decided they wanted to sell at a hundred,‚Äù he said‚Äîdragged the asset down to $74,000 after January‚Äôs euphoric peak, and further tariff-driven shocks could repeat the pattern. Yet the supply-absorption dynamic, buttressed by ETF creations and corporate treasuries, has thus far shortened each corrective phase, allowing spot prices to stabilise in six-figure territory within six weeks of the March trough. The technical and structural narratives therefore converge, Novogratz argues, at the $107,000 pivot. Should that barrier yield, he expects a swift repricing into the $120,000 to $130,000 range‚Äîan advance of roughly 20% that would reset the discussion around how quickly Bitcoin can challenge its inflation-adjusted gold equivalent. Until then, the market waits on a single catalytic print; as the Galaxy CEO put it, ‚Äúas soon as we get a little bit of mojo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to be asking, ‚Äòhow did that happen?‚Äô‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,054.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend Flashes Sell Signal From 2022 Despite BTC/USD Strength. In the last few weeks, the sentiment around Bitcoin has turned around as bulls have pushed it past the $100,000 mark once again. Despite the recent drawdown, the BTC price is still bullish, with the market sentiment sitting in greed. However, a new development on the Bitcoin weekly chart could signal an end to the recent bullishness, just like it did back in 2022. Sell Signal From 2022 Reappears Back in 2022, large sell-offs triggered by the crash of the FTX crypto exchange brought an abrupt end to the Bitcoin bull market and plunged investors into months of despair as prices lagged. During this time, a sell signal on the Bitcoin Weekly SuperTrend went off and the result was the over 60% decline of the Bitcoin price. Since then, this sell signal has remained dormant, but now it has returned. Related Reading: Road To $320,000: Bitcoin Enters Trend Continuation, But $109,400 Must Hold Crypto and CMT-Certified analyst Tony Spilotro took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a disturbing formation on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst explained that the sell signal on the weekly supertrend which had been dormant had finally returned. This signal was triggered just below the current all-time high of $109,000 and it seems the market is playing out accordingly. The analyst explained that while the BTCUSD pair continues to show strength, it could be a false strength. This is because the US dollar has weakened recently, which means that this could be the reason behind the strength shown by the BTC price. Additionally, Tony revealed that even the BTCEUR pair has not shown any crossover of the LMACD. Now, given that this rare bearish signal is flashing right now, it could have some serious implications for the crypto market. The first of these would be that this is the top of the market. In such a case, investors could be looking at another drawn-out bear market. When it comes to how low the price could go, going by the 2022 performance, a 60% crash would bring the Bitcoin price back below $50,000. If this happens, it would ravage the already struggling altcoin market, as well as pushing BTC below the cost price of Strategy‚Äôs 500,000 BTC stash, which opens another can of worms on its own. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market: Pundit Reveals When To Sell Everything Bitcoin Needs To Maintain Range Breakout In another post, Tony explained what needs to happen for the current uptrend to be sustained. He pointed out that range breakouts are only completed in a strong, large weekly candle. In addition, the breakout then needs to close out above the upper Bollinger Band for confirmation. Presently, the BTC price is yet to close out above the upper Bollinger Band, which is sitting at $108,507. However, with two weeks still left to go in the month of May, bulls still have time to complete it before the month closes out. Otherwise, the current breakout could fail, and a reversal could push BTC further down. ‚ÄúBulls want to see this within two weeks, leading to a strong May close,‚Äù Tony Spilotro said.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Next Leg Up Loading? Analyst Says BTC Could Trade Sideways For Two Weeks. After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides.

News,Solana,"Solana Poised For Upside Move After A Bounce From $168 ‚Äì See Why. According to GemXBT on an X post, the Solana chart shows a promising recovery after a recent downtrend, with the price bouncing off a key support level around $168. This price action suggests that SOL has found a solid foundation at this support zone. Support levels like this are important in technical analysis, as they indicate areas where buying interest may be strong enough to halt a decline. A sustained bounce from this level could attract more buyers, fueling further upward momentum and setting the groundwork for a stronger rally in the coming days.¬† Solana Rebound Sparks Hope For A Renewed Rally GemXBT has observed that SOL is currently trading above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, which is a key indicator of bullish price action. When an asset‚Äôs price remains above these moving averages, it suggests that the market sentiment is positive and that the asset could continue to trend upward.¬† Related Reading: Solana Price Rally Targets $360‚ÄîBut This Support Must Hold Additionally, a bullish crossover in the MACD has been noted, which further confirms upward momentum. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is a widely recognized technical signal that suggests the market may continue to favor the bulls, supporting the case for more gains in SOL‚Äôs price. At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally. This price point will likely be an area where sellers may re-enter the market, potentially halting or slowing down the upward performance. A Broadening Wedge On The SOL‚Äôs 4-Hour Chart Whales_Crypto_Trading recently shared an insightful analysis on X, noting that Solana is approaching a key breakout point from a broadening wedge formation on the 4-hour chart. This chart pattern, characterized by fluctuating highs and lows, suggests that the market is experiencing increased volatility and that a decisive price movement is imminent.¬† Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Over $150 ‚Äî More Upside on The Horizon? The broadening wedge typically precedes a breakout, and Whales_Crypto_Trading highlights that the likelihood of an upward breakout is growing. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal the start of a strong rally. When this happens, the analyst suggests that it might trigger a significant uptrend, pushing the price toward key resistance levels at $215, $228, $243, and $265. These levels represent crucial targets where the price may face challenges, but a successful breach of these zones would pave the way for further upward movement.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion DOGE In A Month: Fueling Price Surge Speculation. Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA. A deeper pullback to the $0.20‚Äì$0.195 range would still be considered healthy within the broader uptrend, but any close below the 200 SMA would weaken the bullish outlook.

At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions. However, the key resistance for SOL is near the $180 level, which could present a hurdle for the ongoing rally.

2025-05-16T18:15:20.151791+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 1 Billion DOGE In A Month: Fueling Price Surge Speculation. Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month.

However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support.

2025-05-16T18:48:21.688701+00:00,Bitcoin,News,"Bitcoin Rally Stalls as SOPR Spikes: Analyst Explains What It Means. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb appears to have momentarily slowed following a period of consistent upward momentum. After briefly trading above $104,000 earlier in the week, the price has since retraced to around $102,004, reflecting a modest 1.2% dip in the past 24 hours. Despite the pullback, BTC remains up nearly 20% over the past month and is currently trading 6.4% below its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alem√°n shared insights into the activity of long-term holders (LTHs), suggesting a potential link between the recent pullback and increasing realized profits among seasoned investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio Surges‚ÄîA Warning For Investors? Bitcoin SOPR and Profit-Taking Behavior Signal Distribution Trends According to Alem√°n, the Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) for LTHs has risen significantly since March 12, marking a 71.33% growth in realized profits. This trend may reflect strategic profit-taking among investors who accumulated Bitcoin at lower prices during previous consolidation phases. Alem√°n&#8217;s analysis highlights how Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 150 days, have steadily increased their profit margins over the past two months. As of May 13, the SOPR for LTHs reached 2.27409, indicating that coins moved by these investors were sold at an average return of 227.41%. In practical terms, an investor who bought BTC for $50,000 would have realized roughly $113,705, with $64,000 in profit. This behavior may point to a period of cautious distribution, as experienced holders seek to lock in gains ahead of potential market corrections. Historically, such spikes in SOPR values tend to align with the later stages of market rallies, when price volatility increases and profit-taking accelerates. Alem√°n suggests that while the market has yet to reach its full cycle peak, LTHs may be preparing for such a scenario by adjusting their positions accordingly. This cautious profit-taking could influence near-term price movements, particularly if short-term traders follow the lead of more seasoned market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million By 2028 As Capital Controls Kick In: Top Expert Mixed Signals from LTH Behavior: Selling Slows Despite Price Nearing ATH In contrast to Alem√°n‚Äôs observation, another CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanMarkets, presented a different view of LTH behavior. According to Shayan, while the Bitcoin market is experiencing some profit-taking pressure, long-term holders are not contributing significantly to the selling activity. This view is supported by the declining SOPR metric among LTHs, which suggests that these investors are either holding or continuing to accumulate. This divergence may indicate a shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. Whereas prior rallies were often met with widespread distribution from early adopters, the current trend could be characterized by stronger conviction among institutional or strategic holders. If this behavior continues, Bitcoin may resume its upward momentum once short-term selling pressure subsides. Shayan wrote: Based on this behavior, Bitcoin is likely to resume its bullish trend following this pause, potentially leading to a fresh impulsive rally and new all-time highs in the mid-term.

After reclaiming the crucial $100,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is testing its recently recovered levels as support, with some analysts suggesting that the price will see a short-term sideways move before breaking out of its key resistance. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For $2,850 Rally, But Analysts Warn Of Potential Dip To These Levels Now the chart suggests a consolidation period, which could see Bitcoin move sideways for one to two weeks, if it continues to follow the Global M2 supply path. ‚ÄúOnce that is over, BTC&#8217;s next leg up will start, which will push it above $120K,‚Äù he affirmed. Additionally, Ted pointed out BTC‚Äôs Wyckoff accumulation is in the final phase, with some consolidation happening above the $100,000 support, ‚Äúwhich is a good sign.‚Äù Concluding that, with liquidity entering again, the next leg up ‚Äúwill soon start.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,916, a 0.5% decline in the daily timeframe.

The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line.

At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory. This neutral reading gives Solana the chance to build on its renewed bullish momentum without facing immediate resistance from overbought conditions.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA. A deeper pullback to the $0.20‚Äì$0.195 range would still be considered healthy within the broader uptrend, but any close below the 200 SMA would weaken the bullish outlook.

This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows.

Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels. However, if Bitcoin falls below the lower boundary, around $100,000, it could lose the key support and attempt to fill the CME Gap around the $92,000 before a new ATH rally. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the Global M2 money supply. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price action has resembled the Global M2 supply chart for the past several months, including the recent pump above $100,000.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month.

However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align.

Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance.

At the same time, the RSI is approaching neutral levels, suggesting that there is still room for movement in either direction and that the indicator is not yet in overbought or oversold territory.

Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after surging more than 50% in recent weeks, reclaiming bullish momentum across key timeframes. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency is now facing a critical demand zone, where bulls must hold the line to confirm the potential for continued upside. With market sentiment shifting in favor of risk-on assets, DOGE has emerged once again as one of the leading altcoins, capturing investor attention. Related Reading: Solana Sees Renewed Demand As Capital Flows Turn Positive ‚Äì Details Despite the sharp gains, the rally may just be getting started, especially if on-chain trends are any indication. According to new data from Santiment, whales have accumulated massive amounts of DOGE in the past month. This wave of large-holder accumulation suggests growing confidence among experienced investors and may serve as fuel for another leg up. However, the current levels must act as a launchpad, not a ceiling. If bulls can maintain control and defend local support, a breakout toward previous highs could follow. But if demand begins to weaken, DOGE may enter a consolidation phase before its next big move. For now, all eyes are on how price behaves in this zone of heavy accumulation. One thing is clear: whales are positioning for something. Dogecoin Whale Activity Signals Potential Recovery After months of decline and market-wide fear, Dogecoin is finally showing signs of strength. The meme-coin, long criticized for its volatility, has begun to recover from its recent lows, gaining over 50% in the past few weeks. While DOGE remains more than 50% below its December 2024 high, the latest price action suggests a meaningful shift in momentum may be underway. The overall market backdrop remains uncertain. Weakening macroeconomic data, ranging from slowing GDP growth to shaky consumer sentiment, continue to cast a shadow over risk assets. For now, traders are treading carefully, especially in speculative altcoins like Dogecoin. Still, if DOGE can maintain support above its current levels, analysts believe the recovery could extend into a broader rally. Adding to the bullish narrative, top analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain data showing that whales have accumulated over 1 billion DOGE in the past month. This buying activity‚Äîoften seen as a leading indicator of future moves‚Äîsuggests that large holders are confident in Dogecoin‚Äôs upside potential. It also marks a significant reversal from prior trends of outflows and distribution. If the current support holds, and whale accumulation continues, Dogecoin could be gearing up for another explosive move. While caution remains warranted in the short term, especially if macro conditions worsen, the long-term outlook is strengthening as fundamentals and sentiment slowly begin to align. For now, all eyes are on whether the meme-coin can hold its ground and break through resistance levels that once marked the top of its previous cycles. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2.4K Retest ‚Äì Analyst Sets Key Levels To Watch Price Analysis: Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin is currently consolidating after a sharp rally that took the price from below $0.17 to nearly $0.26 in early May. As shown in the 4-hour chart, DOGE has pulled back to the $0.22‚Äì$0.23 zone, where it‚Äôs attempting to form a local base. This area aligns with the previous breakout structure and sits slightly above the 200 EMA ($0.195) and 200 SMA ($0.183), both of which are now sloping upward, confirming trend support. Volume surged during the breakout, indicating strong interest, but has since declined, suggesting that bulls are pausing to reassess before another potential leg up. The structure now shows a range forming between $0.22 and $0.24, with $0.24 acting as short-term resistance. A break above this level could lead to a retest of the $0.26 high and potentially open the door to $0.28. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands Show Key Resistance Around $3,100 Level ‚Äì Details However, if DOGE loses the $0.22 level, the next support lies around the 200 EMA.

Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes 30% Rally Amid Cup-And-Handle Pattern Breakout BTC‚Äôs Next Key Levels Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a massive performance, recovering more than 23% from the $84,000 mark. The flagship crypto has reclaimed the $100,000 barrier, lost during the February pullback, and rallied to a three-month high of $105,819. Amid the market recovery, BTC has re-entered its post-US elections range, between the $92,000 and $106,000 levels, trading just 4.4% below its January all-time high (ATH). However, the massive rally seems to have slowed after nearing the range&#8217;s upper level, which could momentarily halt its next leg up. This week, Bitcoin has ranged between $101,500-$105,000, taking out most of the liquidation clusters within the weekly range lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that now the cryptocurrency is ‚Äúpretty far away from any large liquidity clusters.‚Äù He explained that BTC‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt traded in the range‚Äôs high for a significant period, and few new positions were built around this area ‚Äúafter the initial squeeze of shorts.‚Äù As such, the main levels to look out for are the range‚Äôs highs above the $106,000 resistance, and the range‚Äôs low around the $93,000 support, where the recent breakout occurred. Bitcoin To Trade Sideways For Two Weeks? Analyst The Cryptonomist considers that BTC‚Äôs price action is ‚Äúvery simple from here,‚Äù as the flagship crypto moves within a one-month rising wedge pattern. If Bitcoin remains inside the formation, it could surge to the $110,000-$112,000 levels.
