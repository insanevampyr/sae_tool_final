It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.</em></p><h2>Ways to earn yield on Bitcoin</h2><p>While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"">bridging</a> BTC to other blockchains.</p><h3>Centralized lending platforms</h3><p>Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"">collapse of firms</a> like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability.&nbsp;</p><h3>WBTC on Ethereum</h3><p>WBTC is an <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"">ERC-20 token</a> backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo). It enables BTC holders to engage in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, such as lending on Aave, <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchange-liquidity-and-why-it-matters-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchange-liquidity-and-why-it-matters-explained"">providing liquidity</a> on Curve or yield farming. This unlocks DeFi&rsquo;s potential but introduces risks from BitGo&rsquo;s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.</p><h3>Bitcoin layer-2 platforms</h3><p>Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin&rsquo;s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after &ldquo;the Merge,&rdquo; replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain&rsquo;s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.</em></p><h2>How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform</h2><p>Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.</p><p>Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.</p></li></ul><p>Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.</p><figure><img alt=""Stake BTC on Binance Earn"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36c-448c-7d76-b618-b502aba3d789"" title="""" /></figure><p>After subscribing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term&rsquo;s end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.</p></li></ul><p>Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.</p><h2>How to earn yield with WBTC on Ethereum</h2><p>WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum&rsquo;s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"">liquidity pools</a> and earning interest or fees.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Convert BTC to WBTC:</strong> Use a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"">centralized exchange (CEX)</a> (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transfer WBTC to a wallet:</strong> Move WBTC to a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"">Web3</a> wallet like <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"">MetaMask</a> and make sure you have enough Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"">gas fees</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect to a DeFi protocol:</strong> Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform&rsquo;s interface.</p></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Connect your wallet to Aave platform"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36d-bb40-714c-bdc9-e4ff139bd2fc"" title="""" /></figure><ul><li><p><strong>Earn yield:</strong> By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.</p></li></ul><h2>How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2s</h2><p>Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon&rsquo;s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with Babylon:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up a compatible wallet:</strong> Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses.

Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em> <em>In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.</em></p><h2>Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocols</h2><p>Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security.</p><h3>Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol</h3><p>Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.</p><h3>Stacking in the Stacks Protocol</h3><p>Stacking is Stacks&rsquo; yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"">STX</a>) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.</p><h2>Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained</h2><p>Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"">deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns</a> for institutional investors outside the US.&nbsp;</p><p>The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"">spot and futures markets</a>, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting annual net returns of 4&ndash;8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin &mdash; an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Risks involved in earning yield with BTC</h2><p>Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Custodial risk:</strong> Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC&rsquo;s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network maturity:</strong> Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market risk:</strong> Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>How earning yield with BTC may evolve</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin&rsquo;s censorship resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources.

By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded.

The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

News,Dogecoin,"Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally ‚Äì Why $1 Is Still In The Cards. The Dogecoin price has seen a major rebound recently, which has brought it above the $0.23 resistance over the weekend. This upward move looks to have been sustained as buyers have regained power over the market in the last week. Despite the already notable rally that the meme coin has enjoyed recently, expectations remain that it will continue to rise higher, with crypto analysts predicting an explosive rally for the altcoin. Dogecoin Price Remains Very Bullish Pseudonymous crypto analyst MMBTtrader on the TradingView website has outlined that the Dogecoin price remains highly bullish. The current pump is expected to continue as Dogecoin has yet to hit any major resistance, thus setting it on a path to possibly double. Related Reading: Dogecoin Undergoes MACD Crossover: Is The $1 Milestone Within Reach? As the crypto analyst points out, the Dogecoin price could likely see a correction after rising so much recently. However, this is expected to only be short-term and would, in fact, fuel the rally and serve as a bounce-off point for further rallies. This corruption could happen just below $0.25. However, the analyst does point out that with the Dogecoin price being so bullish, it is possible that it rises higher than this level before the correction happens. Presently, the only thing holding the Dogecoin price back is the trend line outlined in red in the analyst‚Äôs chart. This serves as a deciding point for the meme coin, and a break above it is expected to push the price forward. In this case, the crypto analyst expects it to rise as high as $0.4. Additionally, they add that if it breaks above $0.4, it would signal an extremely bullish market, pushing the Dogecoin price toward $0.75, and then $1. On the other hand, though, a failure to break above the trend line could signal the beginning of bearish pressure. As the chart shows, the first bearish stop would be at $0.13548. Further downtrend could then send it below $0.1 to $0.09024.

They explain that after the strong bounce of the $0.14 support, Dogecoin is now showing signs of a bullish reversal on the weekly timeframe. This casts a wider net for targets for the meme coin‚Äôs price as the uptrend plays out. From here, the crypto analyst explains that if the Dogecoin price can hold, then the next main target is $1. For this to happen, though, volume confirmation and how the price performs in the next few weeks are crucial. ‚ÄúDOGE might just be gearing up for another historic run,‚Äù the analyst said.
