News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin ETFs Hit $40 Billion Inflows, Setting Historic Crypto Record. Based on figures that Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has shared, spot Bitcoin ETFs have already attracted over $40‚ÄØbillion in lifetime inflows. On May‚ÄØ8,‚ÄØ2025, investors pumped new money in, taking the total to $40 billion. That number indicates that individuals continue purchasing Bitcoin using regulated funds. It also reflects increased confidence from everyday savers as well as large companies. Related Reading: Trump Trade News Ignites Bitcoin Mania‚Äî$100K Coming? Spot ETF Inflows Hit New High The leap to $40.33 billion followed recent inflows on May 8. Funds alone totaled more than the previous record on that single day. Investors have been putting money into the products since their launch early in 2024. Their firm hand has kept ETF flows rising even as prices fluctuated. After yesterdays inflows, the spot Bitcoin ETFs are now at a new high water market for lifetime flows. Currently at $40.33 billion according to Bloomberg data h/t @EricBalchunas pic.twitter.com/0GKPNlmprs ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 9, 2025 Growth Since Launch When US spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in about March‚ÄØ2024, total lifetime inflows was approximately $12‚ÄØbillion. Through August‚ÄØ2024, that figure had increased to about $18‚ÄØbillion. Fast-forward to March‚ÄØ2025, and all-time flows were at nearly $35‚ÄØbillion. They broke the $40‚ÄØbillion barrier in only two more months. That steady increase indicates that interest continues unabated in Bitcoin exposure in the form of a plain-vanilla fund, or no-frills investment vehicle. Institutional Investors Push Demand Big money investors are piling in. Asset managers and hedge funds are now using ETFs to invest in Bitcoin rather than chasing coins individually. It adds a safety layer and hedging for large portfolios, say analysts. It also introduces more scrutiny from regulators, as these ETFs will have to be strictly regulated. Some predict that this change might make Bitcoin seem more like a normal asset. Fans Have Their Say Social media responses were hot following the milestone. &#8220;Bitcoin is dominating,&#8221; posted one user, a line of slang that indicates Bitcoin is overwhelming other assets. Others complimented the ability to achieve buy‚Äëin through regulated channels. None expressed any concerns, although some fear Bitcoin price slowdowns could decelerate ETF flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling The rise above $40 billion is a definite indicator that such ETFs have gained a piece of the market. However, they&#8217;re only one of the means through which Bitcoin is held. Miners, open exchange traders, and off-exchange trades all transfer bigger amounts. In the future, observers will eye ETF flows as a sentiment gauge. If more money streams in, it might be an indication of new confidence. If the tide goes out, it might indicate that buyers are finding alternatives.

News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Price Heading To $137K? Market Expert Says BTC Broke Out Since Nov. 2024. After a somewhat sluggish start to 2025, the Bitcoin price has begun to impress in the year&#8217;s second quarter. The premier cryptocurrency reclaimed the $100,000 mark earlier this week and seems to be making a play for its all-time high price at $108,786 over this weekend. The price of BTC appears to have flipped the switch in the market, with investors feeling that the world‚Äôs largest crypto market is back to where it was at the end of 2024. According to a popular crypto expert, the sell-side pressure experienced in the first few months of the year is all part of a broader price breakout. Is BTC Following This Cup And Handle Pattern? In a May 9 post on X, chartered market technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar shared an interesting update on his recent Bitcoin price analysis. The market expert revealed, in a late November 2024 post on the social media platform, a long-term breakout signal for the BTC price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Following the election victory of Donald Trump as United States President, the Bitcoin and crypto markets witnessed a significant amount of bullish momentum. Kibar highlighted that BTC, as a result of the post-election rally, was breaking above a significant price level on a large (monthly) timeframe. As shown in the chart above, the Bitcoin price broke above its ‚Äúminor high‚Äù around the former all-time high of $73,737 in November. Based on historical patterns, Kibar highlighted in his chart that the flagship cryptocurrency goes on a parabolic run whenever it surpasses the minor high in the cycle. Interestingly, this November 2024 breakout has formed a cup and handle pattern, a technical analysis pattern that resembles a cup in the shape of the letter &#8220;u,&#8221; and the handle has a slight downward drift. The cup and handle is considered a bullish pattern, which signals the continuation of an upward trend. In this particular iteration of this pattern, the price of BTC continued to rally after breaking the $73.737 till it reached a six-figure valuation. However, the Bitcoin price witnessed a severe correction to around $74,000 after reaching its current all-time high in January.¬† However, it appears that Bitcoin only witnessed a minor pullback to the ‚Äúminor high‚Äù before resuming its primary upward trend. In this scenario, Kibar put the cup and handle target for the market leader at around $137,000, which represents an over 33% rally from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,071, reflecting a nearly 1% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader is up by more than 6% on the weekly timeframe.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap. With Bitcoin back above $100,000, crypto analyst Leo Hart has released a 6-month roadmap on the flagship crypto‚Äôs journey to new all-time highs (ATHs). The analyst predicted BTC could rally to as high as $188,000 by the sixth month.¬† The Roadmap For Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄòFlight Plan‚Äô To $188,000 In an X post, Leo Hart outlined Bitcoin&#8217;s ‚Äúflight to the moon‚Äù plan for the next six months, during which he expects the flagship crypto to rally to $188,000. For stage one, which he dubbed the ‚ÄòMaximum Power Law Trend Departure,‚Äô the analyst stated that the target is $108,000, and predicts that BTC will reach this price level in the next two weeks.¬† Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $150,000: BTC Is Mirroring Bullish Fractal From 2020 He further explained that this Bitcoin price level is 36 days from the first quarter point in his mathematical calculation. The analyst also highlighted the green rectangle near the Power Law Trend in his accompanying chart, which shows the maximum deviation from the PLT.¬† For the second stage, ‚ÄòMaximum Absolute Wave Height‚Äô (MAWH), Leo Hart stated that Bitcoin&#8217;s target at this stage is $145,500, and the timeline is two months. This means that BTC can reach this target by July, which would mark a new ATH for the flagship crypto. The analyst noted that this price target is the peak, represented by the horizontal tangent to the upper boundary in the chart. The third stage is the Red Zone Entry Point (RZEP), and the target is $188,000. Bitcoin is expected to reach this price level in the next four months. However, the analyst didn‚Äôt explain why BTC can hit this price level.¬† Meanwhile, he also mentioned a fourth stage called ‚ÄòZero Gravity and Re-entry.‚Äô He explained that beyond stage 3, market participants will enter a zero-gravity phase with unknown parameters, followed by the descent from orbit, hinting at a potential price crash.¬† BTC‚Äôs Journey To A New ATH Has Begun Crypto analyst Rekt Capital indicated that Bitcoin‚Äôs journey to a new all-time high has begun. In an X post, he noted that BTC has rejected from the $104,500 level, which was part of his initial theory on how the flagship crypto could reach a new ATH.¬† Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flashes Signal That Has Led To A Surge Every Time Following this rejection, the analyst predicts that the next step is for Bitcoin to hold the $97,000 to $99,000 range as support. Once that happens, he expects the flagship crypto to break out to new ATHs. His accompanying chart suggested that BTC could rally to $110,000 in the short term. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also confirmed that the $135,000 target is still in play for 2025.¬† At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,400, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

News,Bitcoin,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as UFC Legend Conor McGregor Calls for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in Ireland. &#8216;Victory to Ireland&#8217; is how Connor McGregor signed off on an emphatic call for a Bitcoin strategic reserve in his homeland, Ireland. The legendary UFC fighter becomes the latest A-list celebrity to openly support Bitcoin (and crypto). Others include Mike Tyson, Snoop Dogg, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Maisie Williams. Keep reading to find out everything McGregor had to say in support of crypto. We&#8217;ll also point you towards the best crypto to buy now in order to benefit from the increasing $BTC adoption. McGregor&#8217;s Crypto Stance The entire thing unfolded on X, where McGregor wrote, &#8216;Crypto in it&#8217;s origin was founded to give power back to the people.&#8217; He further said that he&#8217;ll soon be cohosting a Twitter (X) space to give his two cents on the changes he&#8217;d like to see in Ireland&#8217;s crypto policy. Also, this is not McGregor&#8217;s first foray into the crypto space. In 2021, he collaborated with Dapper Labs in an effort to promote blockchain-based collectibles based on UFC. Then, in September 2022, he partnered with a crypto trading application called Tiger.Trade. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Ireland is currently engaged in aligning its cryptocurrency regulations with Europe&#8217;s MiCAR framework. MiCAR stands for Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. Whether or not Ireland will push for a Bitcoin reserve remains to be seen. However, with several countries finally wrapping their heads around $BTC&#8217;s potential, it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone if Ireland follows suit. All in all, with Bitcoin expected to be at the forefront of the next big crypto rally, this could be the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with high-potential tokens like the ones we&#8217;ve mentioned below. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Crypto to Buy Now to Rally Behind $BTC BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an out-and-out Bitcoin fanboy.

Comedian ($BAN) ‚Äì Trending Meme Coin Based on Controversial Art A Bitcoin rally almost always sends meme coin prices soaring. That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re seeing now, with more of the same expected in the coming months. Comedian has been one of the top trending tokens for a while now. It&#8217;s up 58% in the last seven days ‚Äì and a whopping 127% in the last month or so. This new meme coin is inspired by the highly controversial artwork of Maurizio Cattelan, which features a live banana taped to a wall. It really isn&#8217;t tough to wrap your head around why it&#8217;s so infamous. Fans of contemporary art look at it as a representation of &#8216;modern art,&#8217; which they believe is a dig at the greats of the past and not nearly as thought-provoking as it claims to be. However, this particular art piece&#8217;s controversial nature is exactly why $BAN was quick to gain momentum. The token is currently trading at $0.06907, making it one of the best cheap cryptos¬†to¬†buy¬†now. Even the Best Crypto to Buy Now Needs Sound Investing Tactics Before investing in even the best altcoins, make sure you understand the peaks and troughs of the crypto market. The general rule of thumb is to cash in with the momentum and get out before the market corrects. However, because of crypto&#8217;s high volatility, it is incredibly difficult to predict anything with reasonable surety. That&#8217;s why we suggest you only invest a small amount of money, especially if you&#8217;re a beginner. Finally, this article isn&#8217;t financial advice, and you must always do your own research before¬†investing.",0.22,üìà Consider Buying,2025-05-11T01:26:23.051876,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-ufc-legend-conor-mcgregor-calls-for-a-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-in-ireland/
News,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin Headed For A New ATH After $104,000 Triumph? What This Market Expert Thinks. Since reaching a local bottom of $74,000 in mid-April, Bitcoin has seen a market rebound, creating a price uptrend that has lasted over the past three weeks. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency crossed the $100,000 trade mark in the last week to trade as high as $104,300. Following this impressive feat, market analysis X platform NewThoughtCrypto has shared a technical insight on Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Entry Prices Diverge Sharply ‚Äì Confidence Builds At Higher Levels Bitcoin Macro Outlook Shows Charge To New ATH But A Market Correction Awaits In an X post on May 9, analysts at NewThoughtCrypto provided a macro and micro forecast of the Bitcoin market using the Elliott Wave Theory. In terms of the broad market outlook using the daily chart, these pundits explain that Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent to $104,300 marks the top of the fifth wave in an impulse phase, hinting the market is due for a correction. For context, the Elliott wave theory states that prices move in two major repeating patterns, i.e, the impulse phase, which represents the market trend and is broken into five waves (i-v), and the corrective phase, which consists of wave A-B-C. After completing wave V of the impulse trend, NewThoughtCrypto analysts explain that Bitcoin is expected to experience a market correction, the target of which is usually around the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Using the $104,300 price level as a market top, the projected correction could draw prices to $86,000 &#8211; $89,000, a price range around the wave C in the corrective trend.¬†¬† Notably, there is potential for Bitcoin to resume its bullish trend before the correction is over, as there would be a price bounce in line with wave B of the corrective phase. However, NewThoughtCrypto experts expect a complete correction before the premier cryptocurrency relaunches its charge for a new all-time high, which is likely to happen in the summer. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Continuation Shows Rebound, But Resistance Is Mounting At $0.205 Micro Outlook Hints At $106,000 Target Before Correction In a micro view of the Bitcoin market using the 4-hour chart, the analysts at NewThoughtCrypto state Bitcoin appears to have completed waves I, II, and III, with wave III surpassing market expectations. The flagship crypto is now awaiting wave IV, which is always a corrective wave. With a wave III top at $104,300, the expected market correction would push the price to between $100,000 &#8211; $101,000. Thereafter, a bullish wave V is to commence driving prices to $106,000 before the corrective trend begins. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $102,810 following a 0.06% increase in the past day. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 6.68% and valued at $62.23 billion.

News,Ethereum,"Here Are 5 Reasons Ethereum May Reach $12,000 In 2025 ‚Äì Analyst. Ethereum prices have surged by over 19% in the past day, reaching almost $2,500 as a general crypto market resurgence continues. Amidst investors&#8217; euphoria, prominent crypto analyst and OKC Partner Ted Pillows has tipped the prominent altcoin to sustain its bullish form, reaching a market price of $12,000 in 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Between Retail Sell-Off And Whale Accumulation, Analyst Explains Institutional Adoption, DeFi Status To Drive Ethereum Market, Among Others In an X post on May 9, Ted Pillows provided some valuable insights into the bullish potential of the Ethereum market. The angel investor and KOL stated there are five reasons ETH investors should be expecting profits of about 600% before 2025 runs out. Firstly, Pillows has hinted that Ethereum is likely to experience the highest level of institutional adoption among altcoins. Amidst a pro-crypto US government and the growing chances of a digital asset regulatory framework, institutional investors are likely to start diversifying their capital to other cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin. As seen with the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Ethereum ranks high ahead of other altcoins for portfolio additions, considering its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a 7.24% market share, and an extensive smart contract application. In particular, Ted Pillows emphasizes Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in smart contract programmability as another reason for investors to be highly bullish. According to DefiLlama, the Ethereum blockchain currently holds 80.17% of RWA, 51.01% of circulating stablecoins, and 53.29% of total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, indicating much potential for network adoption and price growth amidst a crypto bull market. Another possible market trigger highlighted by Ted Pillows centers on the potential introduction of Ethereum ETF staking. Deadlines for the SEC‚Äôs decision on the proposed staking option lie in late May &#38; late August. However, Bloomberg analyst James Seyfart has indicated there is much potential for the Commission to wait till the final deadline in October, as seen with the ETH options trading. The introduction of staking is likely to drive inflows into the Ethereum ETFs as it provides an additional means of income for investors. Staking would allow ETFs custodians to lock up ETH on the Ethereum network to serve as a validator for a defined period and earn a commission in return. Token Burn Post-Pectra Upgrade Signals Good Times Ahead¬† Among other potential bullish drivers, Ted Pillows also points to the high level of ETH Burn following the launch of the Pectra network upgrade on May 7. A high burn rate indicates rising scarcity, which is always good for the market price appreciation. Finally, Ted Pillows hints at the growing potential of a risk-on environment later in 2025 as the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates and begin quantitative easing, which would encourage investments in volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies. At press time, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,334 following a slight market retracement in the last few hours. Notably, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is up by 62.81% and valued at $49.85 billion.
