At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.</p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.</em></p><h2>Ways to earn yield on Bitcoin</h2><p>While you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blockchain-bridges-explained"">bridging</a> BTC to other blockchains.</p><h3>Centralized lending platforms</h3><p>Centralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-many-expected-cites-ftx-collapse-for-its-troubles"">collapse of firms</a> like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability.&nbsp;</p><h3>WBTC on Ethereum</h3><p>WBTC is an <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/erc-20-tokens-explained"">ERC-20 token</a> backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo).

This unlocks DeFi&rsquo;s potential but introduces risks from BitGo&rsquo;s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.</p><h3>Bitcoin layer-2 platforms</h3><p>Emerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin&rsquo;s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em><em> Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after &ldquo;the Merge,&rdquo; replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain&rsquo;s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.</em></p><h2>How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platform</h2><p>Earning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.</p><p>Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.</p></li></ul><p>Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.</p><figure><img alt=""Stake BTC on Binance Earn"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36c-448c-7d76-b618-b502aba3d789"" title="""" /></figure><p>After subscribing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Simple Earn:</strong> BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term&rsquo;s end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Investment:</strong> Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Yield:</strong> Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.</p></li></ul><p>Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.</p><h2>How to earn yield with WBTC on Ethereum</h2><p>WBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum&rsquo;s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-liquidity-pools-explained"">liquidity pools</a> and earning interest or fees.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Convert BTC to WBTC:</strong> Use a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-exchanges-explained"">centralized exchange (CEX)</a> (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transfer WBTC to a wallet:</strong> Move WBTC to a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future"">Web3</a> wallet like <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/metamask-tutorial-for-beginners-how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet"">MetaMask</a> and make sure you have enough Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-too-low-or-high-no-one-can-decide"">gas fees</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect to a DeFi protocol:</strong> Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform&rsquo;s interface.</p></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Connect your wallet to Aave platform"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c36d-bb40-714c-bdc9-e4ff139bd2fc"" title="""" /></figure><ul><li><p><strong>Earn yield:</strong> By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.</p></li></ul><h2>How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2s</h2><p>Layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon&rsquo;s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.</p><p>Steps to earn yield with Babylon:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up a compatible wallet:</strong> Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses.

Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em> <em>In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.</em></p><h2>Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocols</h2><p>Layer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin&rsquo;s security.</p><h3>Native time-locked scripts in Babylon Protocol</h3><p>Babylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.</p><h3>Stacking in the Stacks Protocol</h3><p>Stacking is Stacks&rsquo; yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/stacks-stx-price-index"">STX</a>) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.</p><h2>Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) Explained</h2><p>Coinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-to-launch-yield-bearing-bitcoin-fund-for-institutions"">deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns</a> for institutional investors outside the US.&nbsp;</p><p>The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"">spot and futures markets</a>, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeting annual net returns of 4&ndash;8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin &mdash; an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p><h2>Risks involved in earning yield with BTC</h2><p>Generating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Custodial risk:</strong> Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC&rsquo;s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk:</strong> WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network maturity:</strong> Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market risk:</strong> Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>How earning yield with BTC may evolve</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin&rsquo;s censorship resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin&rsquo;s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you?

By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded.

The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,&rdquo; commented Ben Adams.</p><p>A sentiment that was <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617/7"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoed</a> by another anonymous commenter, &ldquo;I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.&rdquo;</p><p>Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‚ÄòLooks Incredible Here,‚Äô Says Crypto Analyst ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 spike‚Äîfueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù appearance‚Äîas a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is ‚Äúnowhere near crossing,‚Äù implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‚ÄòLooks Incredible Here,‚Äô Says Crypto Analyst ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 spike‚Äîfueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù appearance‚Äîas a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is ‚Äúnowhere near crossing,‚Äù implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, President Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources.

While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-layers-of-blockchain-technology"">layer-1 blockchain</a> works.</p><p>Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn&rsquo;t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you?

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations.

Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April.

Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,&rdquo; commented Ben Adams.</p><p>A sentiment that was <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617/7"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoed</a> by another anonymous commenter, &ldquo;I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.&rdquo;</p><p>Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery.

Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

A short-term pullback wouldn‚Äôt invalidate the trend, but failure to hold above $2,500 could stall momentum.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Dogecoin,"Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $1? Analyst Sees Strong Setup. Dogecoin‚Äôs muted spring rally has reignited a perennial retail question: can the world‚Äôs best-known meme coin break the $1 barrier before the current market upswing exhausts itself? In a 13-minute market update published on Sunday, independent strategist Kevin‚Äîknown online as Kev Capital TA‚Äîanswered with an unequivocal ‚Äúyes,‚Äù pointing to a confluence of long-term Fibonacci targets, momentum indicators and a macro backdrop he believes is finally turning supportive for high-beta crypto assets. Is $1 Realistic For Dogecoin? ‚ÄúCan Dogecoin hit $1 this cycle? The answer is yes, it absolutely can,‚Äù Kevin told his followers at the outset of the video. He argued that Dogecoin is now in its third major cycle and has historically advanced to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the monthly chart. That extension currently sits at roughly $3.80, ‚Äúwell above a dollar,‚Äù he noted, while stressing that citing the level is ‚Äúnot a price call‚Äù but a way to frame upside potential. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Reach $0.60? This Price Level Is Now Crucial Kevin‚Äôs conviction rests on momentum gauges that, in his reading, show Dogecoin barely warming up. On the monthly relative-strength index, he traced an ascending trend that has been intact since the post-Luna crash lows in June 2022. ‚ÄúWe hit roughly 50 cents with the monthly RSI at 75,‚Äù he said, adding that in prior cycles the indicator climbed to at least 89.4. ‚ÄúLook how much room we have to go.‚Äù A fresh bullish crossover in the monthly stochastic oscillator would, in his view, confirm the move. The analyst also linked Dogecoin‚Äôs prospects to a macro mix he characterises as increasingly benign: expectations for US rate cuts, a deceleration in quantitative tightening and a rise in global liquidity. He contended that these forces, coupled with a downturn in Bitcoin dominance that his desk called on 28 April at 65.45%, create the conditions for a classic ‚Äúalt-season.‚Äù ‚ÄúAltcoins are oscillators to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ monetary policy being easier on the economy is what drives that liquidity into the market,‚Äù he explained. Key chart landmarks remain in focus. Kevin cited a ‚Äúperfect inverse head-and-shoulders‚Äù accumulation which he entered at an average price of $0.15‚Äînow ‚Äúup 65‚Äì70%‚Äù‚Äîand set sequential objectives at $0.48 and the previous all-time high near $0.74. The $1 level would follow only if liquidity trends continue to improve and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äúdurably‚Äù breaks down. ‚ÄúRealistically, if we keep seeing this path of easing monetary policy‚Ä¶ we can absolutely see Dogecoin at a dollar by the end of the year,‚Äù he concluded. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‚ÄòLooks Incredible Here,‚Äô Says Crypto Analyst ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why Sceptics might flag Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 spike‚Äîfueled by social-media fervour and Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù appearance‚Äîas a one-off event; Kevin counters that the same Pi-cycle moving-average pair that nailed prior tops is ‚Äúnowhere near crossing,‚Äù implying headroom before froth returns. The shorter-term yellow average, he said, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt even start moving higher until Dogecoin hits 40 to 41 cents,‚Äù leaving a notional 145% cushion between today‚Äôs price and $1 even in an advancing market. Although Kevin acknowledged that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to make money, we‚Äôre not here to get attached,‚Äù he tempered expectations of parabolic targets circulating on social media. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to turn this into a Dogecoin to $35 video‚Ä¶ This is a video based on facts,‚Äù he told viewers, urging them to treat $1 as an ambitious but data-driven milestone rather than a guarantee. With Dogecoin hovering near $0.25 at press time, the meme coin would need a four-fold rally to tag the psychologically potent dollar mark.

However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.</p><h2>Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over gold</h2><p>While traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Bitcoin Outpaces Stocks According to reports, the S&#38;P 500 declined almost 1% during April, but Bitcoin rose. Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April.

Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000.

Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable.

Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86.

The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain&rsquo;s <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/block-size-and-scalability-explained"">scalability</a> constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer&rsquo;s simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.</p><p>The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,&rdquo; <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617"">said Buterin</a>.</p><p>Ethereum continues to face high <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/transaction-fees-explained"">transaction fees</a> and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,&rdquo; commented Ben Adams.</p><p>A sentiment that was <a href=""https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/long-term-l1-execution-layer-proposal-replace-the-evm-with-risc-v/23617/7"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">echoed</a> by another anonymous commenter, &ldquo;I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.&rdquo;</p><p>Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?&rdquo; <a href=""https://www.mitrade.com/insights/news/live-news/article-5-772078-20250422"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">added</a> Adam Cochran.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-layers-of-blockchain-technology"">layer-1 blockchain</a> works.</p><p>Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn&rsquo;t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin&rsquo;s proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.</p>                    </div></div>

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

News,Solana,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">BREAKING: U.S. Announces China Trade Deal in Geneva <a href=""https://t.co/JjgvYAvAGe"">pic.twitter.com/JjgvYAvAGe</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1921623939060519353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">May 11, 2025</a></blockquote><p>As news of the tentative deal broke, US equity futures markets soared, and these gains materialized into a 1,000-point rally in the Dow at the opening bell. Looking beyond the temporary resolution of the US-China trade war, Bitcoin has racked up back-to-back wins over the past two weeks. On May 12, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/strategy-buys-13-390-bitcoin-for-1-34-b-as-price-pushes-100-k"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">13,390 Bitcoin</a>, bringing its total balance to 568,840 BTC.&nbsp;</p><p>On the same day, shares of healthcare company KindlyMD surged up to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/kindlymd-trump-crypto-david-bailey-nakamoto.html"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">600%</a> after announcing the merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, who is Trump&rsquo;s current crypto adviser.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets.

News,Bitcoin,"Toobit Experts Predict: When Will Bitcoin Hit 200k in 2025?. As the cryptocurrency market continues its rollercoaster journey, investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. With whispers of a $200,000 price tag circulating, many are wondering if this bold milestone is within reach in 2025. Toobit experts, known for their data-driven insights and deep understanding of market dynamics, have weighed in on this pressing question. Here‚Äôs what we predict:¬† Why is Bitcoin Going Up? Toobit experts attribute the recent surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price to several factors. First, the ongoing expansion of the crypto strategic reserve by major financial institutions has provided a solid foundation for BTC‚Äôs long-term growth. This move signals increased institutional confidence, which often triggers broader market optimism. Additionally, the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which significantly reduces the rate at which new coins are mined, is expected to cut supply and increase scarcity, further pushing the price upward. Bitcoin Dominance and Market Influence Another critical factor driving this potential rise is Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. Historically, Bitcoin dominance ‚Äì the measure of BTC‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market ‚Äì tends to climb during bull runs. This dominance is seen as a marker of overall market confidence, often leading to new Bitcoin all-time highs as investors flock to the most trusted digital asset during times of economic uncertainty. Why Toobit Experts Believe BTC Will Hit 200k in Late 2025 Toobit experts anticipate that the convergence of multiple macroeconomic and crypto-specific trends will drive BTC toward the $200,000 mark. Key factors include the continued institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the maturation of the broader crypto market, and a potential influx of retail investors seeking refuge from inflation and economic instability. This combination of reduced supply, increased demand, and heightened global interest sets a strong foundation for Bitcoin to potentially break past its previous all-time high and reach this ambitious target. Path to $200,000: The Key Catalysts Institutional Adoption: With companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and the rise of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional participation is expected to skyrocket. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce market fear and attract more traditional investors. Geopolitical Instability: Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation continues to grow amid global economic tensions. Final Verdict: When Will Bitcoin Really Hit 200k in 2025? Toobit experts remain cautiously optimistic. They believe that if macroeconomic conditions align, and the crypto market maintains its upward momentum, Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by late 2025 is not just possible, but probable. However, they caution that such a price surge would require sustained adoption and a continued narrative of digital gold, coupled with market maturity to withstand external shocks. As always, potential investors should approach this market with a long-term perspective and a solid risk management strategy.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-layers-of-blockchain-technology"">layer-1 blockchain</a> works.</p><p>Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn&rsquo;t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood.

It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Stays Resilient While Wall Street Stumbles ‚Äì Details. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has surged some 25% since April 2, even as the big stock indexes declined. The digital currency broke through $104,000 by May 12. Traditional markets such as the S&#38;P 500 were in the red simultaneously. Based on market data, Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience has stood out in the face of sell-offs and tariff negotiations. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Grip Loosens: Market Expert Says Dominance Has Hit Its Ceiling Bitcoin Outpaces Stocks According to reports, the S&#38;P 500 declined almost 1% during April, but Bitcoin rose. Other financial markets experienced losses during the same weeks. Bitcoin&#8217;s increase was made while traders considered concerns over escalating tariffs. The world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset was seen by some as a means to avoid fees on foreign trade. However, there is no evidence that any country utilized crypto to avoid tariffs. Settlements Via Bitcoin Based on examination by crypto expert Daan Crypto Trades, there was speculation that countries could bring trade settlements to Bitcoin. The concept gained traction since BTC stood firm even when supply chains and markets were in trouble. $BTC Has outperformed stocks since &#8220;Liberation&#8221; / Tariff Day on the 2nd of April. It held up incredibly strong during a sharp sell off on stocks in April. It then also proceeded to outperform as the markets bounced and tariffs were implemented.

Regulators would catch any large cross-border payments made in crypto. There has not been a reported case of governments turning to Bitcoin in order to sidestep duties. Testing Key Resistance Levels According to chart analysis by Rose Premium Signals, Bitcoin is currently testing a crucial barrier at $105,000. If BTC breaks down there, it might retreat into the $100,000 zone. Some pattern observers claim an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders configuration could develop. üí∞ $BTC Market Update#Bitcoin is currently testing the Weekly Supply Zone around $105,000 üëÄ üß† The most likely scenario is a rejection from this level, leading to the formation of an Inverse Head &#38; Shoulders pattern ‚Äî a setup that could create space for a mini #altseason üìà‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/aLSPi5qhuq ‚Äî Rose Premium Signals üåπ (@VipRoseTr) May 11, 2025 That pattern requires two distinct shoulders and a lower trough in the middle. Currently, the swings have been unbalanced, muddying the image. A rejection might be followed by a brief period of altcoin accumulation before Bitcoin takes off again where it left off. Related Reading: New XRP Rally Incoming? Analyst Believes This Cycle Is Unique Long-Term Outlook Stable As per market observers, most investors will be looking to purchase dips if Bitcoin breaks resistance. They add that higher prices will put the limelight on pullbacks. Dips provided entry points during previous rallies. But Bitcoin&#8217;s extensive runs persist for several months, not days. Risks are still seen by traders: potential rate increases, regulations on crypto, and fresh tokens competing for attention. Meanwhile, increasing ETF flows and fortified wallets reassure others. Based on accounts of US‚ÄìChina trade negotiations, any agreement would reduce some tension. But there are drivers of Bitcoin&#8217;s price that are independent of global tariffs. Monetary actions, large investors, and sentiment drive big moves. If BTC continues to outrun stocks, it might solidify itself as an alternative in global markets. In the meantime, traders are waiting for the next direction at those important levels near $105,000.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed &ldquo;The Merge,&rdquo; the chain switched from a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/proof-of-work-explained"">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/proof-of-authority-vs-proof-of-stake-key-differences-explained"">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert.

After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T22:45:11.392486+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-12T23:45:11.285874+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

News,Ethereum,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other.

News,Solana,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

It&rsquo;s a yearly tax on a person&rsquo;s total net worth &mdash; cash, investments, property and other assets &mdash; minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.</p><p>Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world&rsquo;s biggest economies &mdash; like the US, Australia and France &mdash; have largely steered clear.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) be labeled &ldquo;unproductive,&rdquo; which would mean taxing its gains every year &mdash; whether or not it&rsquo;s ever sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yep, every asset holder&rsquo;s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea.&nbsp;</p><p>With Bitcoin&rsquo;s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest&rsquo;s Cathie Wood eyeing a<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-odds-1-5-m-increase-institutionalization-cathie-wood"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $1.5-million price tag by 2030</a>, I&rsquo;d bet a magic 8-ball would say, &ldquo;Signs point to yes.&rdquo;</p><h2>The growing global interest in wealth tax</h2><p>It might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.</p><p>The incentive is obvious. Switzerland&rsquo;s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio&rsquo;s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.</p><p>Countries catch on &mdash; sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.</p><p>The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985.&nbsp;</p><h2>Governments likely considering the wealth tax</h2><p>Governments are likely entertaining the idea &mdash; whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-floats-23-percent-tax-crypto-excludes-stablecoins""><em><strong>Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoins</strong></em></a></p><p>In July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/germany-lost-124m-profit-selling-bitcoin"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> $58,000 might have seemed</a> like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, a costly mistake&hellip;</p><p>Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK&rsquo;s gold reserves at $275 an ounce?&nbsp;</p><p>Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.</p><p>To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money &mdash; specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.</p><h2>The potential repercussions of a wealth tax</h2><p>Will nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?</p><p>Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve &mdash; a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.</p><p>If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.</p><p>One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won&rsquo;t sit back quietly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.</em></p>                    <div id=""explained-block-190879-2"">            <h2>                How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.</p><p><img alt=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1e3248a3d0f3cb82b1e9f40ed0cdb6f3.jpg"" title=""Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x"" /></p><p>RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, RISC-V&rsquo;s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than rebuilding the EVM for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained"">ZK-proofs</a>, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T00:45:13.232376+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer.

ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

If Bitcoin is McCann‚Äôs 70% core position, Solana is his high-conviction satellite. He credits the network‚Äôs throughput during last month‚Äôs Trump-branded meme-coin launch‚Äî‚Äúthe chain did not suffer; it hummed right along‚Äù‚Äîas a proof-of-scale moment. Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year. After reaching a weekly low below $1,400 just a few weeks ago, ETH has rallied aggressively, closing this week near $2,555‚Äîa 45% surge that marks its most explosive candle in over a year. The chart shows ETH pushing past the 200-week EMA at ~$2,259 and reclaiming the 200-week SMA at ~$2,451. Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T01:43:09.861849+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level.

However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.</p><h2>Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over gold</h2><p>While traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative. For example, gold fell 3.4% on May 12 as the demand for safe-haven assets declined.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price sells off after Trump&rsquo;s US-China tariff deal &mdash; Here is why"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c603-c888-76f6-aec9-e6c01bf84e4a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>Gold/USD (left) vs. DXY US Dollar Index (right).

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Targets $110,000 All-Time High After Consolidation Trend Ends. Over the past three days, Bitcoin has hovered between $103,000 and $104,500, creating a narrow channel after a notable rally that saw it break above $100,000 last week. Technical analysis of the daily candlestick chart shows the formation of a minor impulsive wave from $103,000, which may mark the final end of the recent consolidation and the beginning of a fresh rally towards new highs.¬†¬† Notably, recent price action in the past 12 hours or so has seen the gradual end of the consolidation, and attention is now turning to the next psychological level at $110,000.¬† Analyst Sees Breakout As Signal For Upside Continuation In a post shared on the social media platform X, crypto analyst CrediBULL explained the logic behind his current long trade setup, pointing out that Bitcoin has broken away from its three-day consolidation zone with an early impulse that started at the $103,000 level. His analysis predicted that this movement could be the start of a much larger leg upward, especially if the current price structure holds without falling back into a local demand zone between $101,000 and $102,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap According to CrediBULL, the current trade has a clean invalidation level just below the impulse origin, allowing for a tight stop loss. This setup yields a high reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5:1, with an upside target of $110,660, as illustrated in the chart. If this breakout is genuine, it could be a signal that Bitcoin is preparing for an aggressive push toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, CrediBULL cautioned that if the current move proves to be a deviation and price falls below the impulse origin, focus should shift to the local demand zone around $101,800. The chart supports this with a clearly marked green area labeled ‚Äúlocal demand.‚Äù This is the next major support if Bitcoin bulls fail to hold the current price levels. $110,000 Bitcoin Target In Sight With Increasing Market Momentum According to the crypto analyst, his prediction of the next move to $110,000 has at least a 20% chance of playing out. These odds are quite nice, considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market.¬† Related Reading: What‚Äôs Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $100,000 And Is It Sustainable? Notably, price action in the past 24 hours has seen the leading cryptocurrency break above $105,000 again, peaking at an intraday high of $105,503 before easing slightly. This move strengthens the case that the recent consolidation phase may have concluded, and a successful move above $110,000 before the end of the week is underway. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,428. A successful rally to the $110,660 target would represent a 6% gain from the current price, while downside risk is capped below the $103,000 level.

News,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin To $400,000, Solana To $420, Ethereum Dead Weight, Says Fund Manager. In an interview that spanned everything from macro-economics to meme-coin mania, veteran trader and Asymmetric founder Joe McCann laid out a forceful‚Äîbut narrowly targeted‚Äîthesis: Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional flows can propel it to the high six-figure range, Solana is ‚Äúthe fastest horse‚Äù toward a mid-three-digit print, and Ethereum‚Äôs investment case is increasingly threadbare. Bitcoin To $400,000 McCann began by striking at one of crypto‚Äôs longest-lived touchstones. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clear to anyone who follows crypto that the four-year cycle is effectively dead,‚Äù he told host Scott Melker, arguing that traditional patterns of post-halving rotation have been overwhelmed by spot-ETF inflows and by what he calls an unprecedented ‚Äúheadline-driven market.‚Äù Those flows, he said, are only beginning. Sovereign wealth funds, pensions, and corporations are ‚Äúhoarding Bitcoin the way they once hoarded gold,‚Äù but unlike bullion, the supply cap is immutable. With uncertainty indices at all-time highs and US trade policy setting the tempo of risk assets, McCann sees a probabilistic path toward enormous upside once ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù on tariffs are understood. Related Reading: Bitcoin 6-Month Flight Plan To $188,000, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ‚ÄúIf Trump does deregulation, if he chills out on tariff policy, you could see Bitcoin actually rip two, three, four-hundred thousand dollars. It really is just a number. It‚Äôs more about the flows.‚Äù Pressed for timing, the CEO of Asymmetric would not anchor to a specific date, but he did outline the mechanics: reflexive price action in a thinly supplied market. Bitcoin, still a ‚Äúfraction of the market cap of gold,‚Äù now trades in an environment where gold‚Äôs 40% year-to-date rally has revived the digital-gold narrative. A break of the Bitcoin-gold cross to the upside could lure capital away from bullion ‚Äúsimply because it‚Äôs easier to transport and censorship-resistant.‚Äù The implication is that a decisive break above the psychological $100,000 could accelerate quickly to the headline figure of $400,000 on ETF demand alone‚Äîparticularly if the US administration moves ahead with initiatives such asUS President Donald Trump Strategic Bitcoin Reserve buys in a budget neutral way or Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äôs proposal.

Wallet abstractions such as Moonshot, and the migration of stable-coin flows from Ethereum, have in his view removed the UX friction that capped the last cycle. ‚ÄúWhen the most popular person on the planet launches a meme-coin on Solana, what does that tell you? We have infrastructure ready for mass adoption.‚Äù Related Reading: Sovereigns Are Buying Billions Of Bitcoin, Says Anthony Scaramucci With spot-Solana ETFs already live in Canada and US filings advancing, he projects that ‚Äúgiven the fundamentals coupled with ETF flows‚Ä¶ Solana‚Äôs got to be at least $420,‚Äù a figure he reiterated more than once. By contrast, McCann‚Äôs hedge-fund book carries only one structural short: ETH. He offered a blunt rationale: once-innovative technology, but an asset now ‚Äúbeing cannibalized by its own L2s.‚Äù With gas averaging one cent, fee revenue is insufficient to reward holders, and institutional channels prefer tokens that either accrue protocol cash-flow or sit inside ETF wrappers‚Äîcriteria he does not see Ethereum satisfying. ‚ÄúThe asset is not worth owning,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúAnytime Ethereum rips, usually take profits across the board on everything.‚Äù McCann doubts the return of the indiscriminate ‚Äúalt-season‚Äù that characterised prior tops. Liquidity, he argued, has bifurcated into Bitcoin ETFs on one end and high-velocity meme-coin venues such as Pump.Fun on the other. Tokens in between must now defend themselves with ‚Äúreal protocol revenue, not just governance.‚Äù If they do, he foresees a coming wave of dividend-style crypto ETFs aimed at yield-hungry boomers; if they don‚Äôt, ‚Äúmost of them will trade to zero.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $104,528.

This aligns with Ethereum&rsquo;s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin&rsquo;s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Ethereum&rsquo;s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck.

Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.</em></p><p>The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"">ETH</a>) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach, described as &ldquo;more radical,&rdquo; would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.</p><p>A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications"">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and smart contracts. Ethereum can&rsquo;t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter &mdash; essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong>In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability.

In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts&rsquo; performance and processing.</em></p><p>According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V&rsquo;s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Hits Major Level After Biggest Weekly Candle In Years ‚Äì What Comes Next?. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum after a powerful 45% surge last week, reclaiming key price levels and fueling speculation about the start of a broader altseason. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now pushing into critical resistance zones that could define the next leg of this rally. After months of underperformance and bearish sentiment, ETH‚Äôs sudden strength is shifting investor focus back toward the altcoin market, with analysts pointing to Ethereum‚Äôs breakout as a potential spark for widespread recovery across the sector. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs recent move. According to Daan, the massive weekly candle‚Äîone of the largest in years‚Äîwas driven by a combination of technical breakout and short squeezes, as a large number of bearish positions were caught off guard. This surge not only invalidated recent bearish structures but also marked a structural shift in momentum. With Ethereum now pressing into new territory and investor confidence rising, the market appears poised for renewed strength. If ETH continues to hold above current levels, it could pave the way for altcoins to follow in what may become the strongest altseason since 2021. Ethereum Reclaims Strength As It Tests Key Resistance Ethereum is finally showing signs of strength after months of sustained bearish pressure. Since late December 2024, ETH had been in a steady downtrend, losing more than 66% of its value as investors rotated into other assets amid macroeconomic uncertainty and dwindling altcoin demand. However, a major shift in sentiment emerged in early April, as Ethereum began climbing rapidly, gaining over 85% in just a few weeks. This rally has brought ETH back into critical resistance levels that could determine whether a sustained uptrend is now underway. Daan highlighted the significance of this move, stating that Ethereum is now at a ‚Äúbig level.‚Äù He noted that last week‚Äôs price action produced the largest weekly candle in years‚Äîan explosive move fueled by a massive short squeeze. Months of built-up bearish positions were flushed out as the rally caught many by surprise, sending prices sharply higher. Daan cautions that while the move is impressive, the next phase is about managing volatility: ‚ÄúPlay this level by level,‚Äù he advises, ‚Äúand watch for next week to develop to see where these alts are going to get picked up after the squeezes are done.‚Äù This moment is crucial not only for Ethereum but also for the broader altcoin market. ETH‚Äôs recovery is often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite and capital rotation into smaller assets. With bulls now in control and price pressing into a key supply zone, how Ethereum behaves over the coming days could determine whether altseason truly begins‚Äîor whether this rally was just a reaction to overly bearish positioning. Either way, ETH‚Äôs strength has put the market back on alert. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Technical View: Price Surges Above Weekly Moving Averages Ethereum is showing clear signs of recovery on the weekly timeframe, breaking decisively above the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since its downtrend began earlier this year.

Analysts often use these two long-term trend indicators to distinguish between bear and bull market phases. Ethereum‚Äôs ability to close above both signals a potential shift in sentiment and structure, especially after months of lower highs and declining volume. Volume on this breakout is also notable. The past two weeks have seen a significant uptick in participation, suggesting this move isn‚Äôt just a short squeeze, but potentially the start of a broader recovery trend. ETH still faces resistance in the $2,700‚Äì$2,800 zone, but reclaiming this range could open the door for a sustained rally into Q3. The next few candles will be key in confirming this bullish reversal. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.05,ü§ù Hold / Watch,2025-05-13T01:45:10.603295+00:00,
News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Recovery Gains Strength: Massive Comeback Above Key Support. Ethereum is back above the $2,500 level after a massive surge that flipped market sentiment nearly overnight. Following months of intense selling pressure that began in late December 2024, ETH spent most of the first quarter struggling to gain traction. However, last week‚Äôs powerful rally‚Äîan 80% gain in less than a month‚Äîhas shifted the tone across the market, reigniting optimism and setting the stage for what could be the beginning of a broader altcoin recovery. Related Reading: Solana Rallies Into Pivotal Zone ‚Äì $180 Level Could Define Next Move Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis noting that while Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is impressive, the asset still has ‚Äúa lot of work to do.‚Äù ETH is now testing a key supply zone that previously marked significant resistance. Whether bulls can push through this area or face a temporary rejection remains to be seen. Still, the magnitude and speed of this recovery suggest that Ethereum may have completed a capitulation bottom and is building toward a more sustainable uptrend. For now, reclaiming $2,500 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. With momentum turning and broader market strength building, Ethereum‚Äôs price action in the coming days could help define the trajectory for the entire altcoin sector in Q2. Ethereum Tests Key Resistance After Explosive Weekly Surge Ethereum has surged over 44% in less than a week, reclaiming major resistance levels with strength and shifting sentiment sharply from bearish to bullish. After months of underperformance, ETH is now leading the charge in what many analysts believe could be the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. The broader market is showing signs of renewed momentum, but Ethereum‚Äôs breakout is particularly significant as it often signals capital rotation into altcoins. ETH‚Äôs rally has taken it from sub-$1,800 levels to just above $2,500, breaking through key resistance areas that had held since January. Now, the price is testing a crucial supply zone between $2,600 and $2,800‚Äîa region that previously acted as a distribution top and major rejection point. A successful break above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,000 and beyond. Jelle highlighted the scale of Ethereum‚Äôs comeback, noting that this ‚Äúmassive bounce‚Äù came after the market had largely declared ETH dead. Prices are now firmly back above critical support, and the reclaim of $2,500 is a major technical milestone. Still, as Jelle points out, there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead before a full recovery is confirmed. While short-term momentum is clearly bullish, Ethereum must consolidate and build structure above this resistance to establish a sustainable uptrend. If that happens, the narrative for altseason becomes significantly stronger, especially after years of drawdowns across the sector. The coming days will be key as Ethereum tests the upper end of this resistance range and sets the tone for altcoins heading into the summer. Related Reading: HYPE Bulls Regain Control After Sharp Recovery ‚Äì Approaching Yearly Highs? ETH Tests $2,600 Resistance As Momentum Builds Ethereum is trading at $2,570 after an explosive rally that pushed the price from under $1,800 to a new local high at $2,625 in just a few sessions. The chart shows a clear vertical breakout, driven by surging volume and reclaim of major moving averages. ETH has now decisively broken above its 200-day EMA (currently near $2,436) and is testing the 200-day SMA around $2,701‚Äîa zone that represents a significant area of supply. The steep angle of ascent suggests strong bullish momentum, but the price is approaching a key resistance confluence. Historically, the $2,600‚Äì$2,800 range has acted as both support and resistance, meaning bulls need to consolidate above $2,500 to sustain the uptrend. This move also follows months of consolidation and a long period of underperformance. After a 66% decline from its December highs, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally signals a potential trend reversal. If bulls maintain this pressure and break above the 200 SMA, it could trigger a rapid continuation to $3,000 and beyond.

News,Ethereum,"Ethereum Price Completes Bullish Structure Break ‚Äì $3,000 Comes Next. According to a fresh analysis by a crypto analyst,¬† the Ethereum price has broken out of a months-long downtrend, reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. With volume rising and key resistance levels expected to turn into support, Ethereum is set to complete its bullish structure, aiming for a potential break toward $3,000.¬† Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 Breakout The Ethereum price action on the 4-hour chart has reportedly flipped bullish, following a sharp breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped its movements since late 2024. As a result, a pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòOrihadad66‚Äô has predicted that Ethereum could soon see a surge to $3,000.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Surge Above $2,200 Says Bear Market Is Over, Analyst Calls $5,791 ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô Target The analyst explains that Ethereum‚Äôs recent shift from bearish to bullish wasn‚Äôt a subtle move, as a high-volume candle had pierced through both the trendline and the $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 resistance zone, confirming a clearer shift in market structure. This breakout is significant, as it marks the first time Ethereum has invalidated the broader bearish pattern that dominated the early part of 2025.¬† The $2,100 &#8211; $2,150 area now acts as a potential support zone for its price, and a successful retest would solidify it as a launchpad for further upside. Orihadad66 has confirmed that the immediate bullish target for Ethereum lies between the $2,500 &#8211; $2,550 price range. Historically, this region has been a key liquidity zone where previous price rejections frequently occurred. This makes the zone a potential profit-taking area as ETH consolidates post-breakout.¬† Technical projections suggest that Ethereum may briefly pull back toward the $2,350 &#8211; $2,400 range to form a potential higher low. If this pullback holds, bulls could drive the next leg up toward $2,800 &#8211; $3,000 ‚Äî a confluence zone that includes both a supply barrier and psychological resistance. Furthermore, the TradingView analyst has predicted that a clean break above $3,000 could open the door to the $3,300 &#8211; $3,600 supply block, potentially triggering a larger bullish trend reversal. With Ethereum currently trading at $2,544, a surge to $3,000 or even $3,600 would represent a 17.9% and 41.5% increase, respectively.¬† Bullish Thesis At Risk Below $2,100 While the analysis published by Orihadad66 has highlighted Ethereum‚Äôs almost completed bullish structure and potential breakout target, the setup also comes with a clear invalidation level. The TradingView analyst has warned that a 4-hour candle close below the $2,100 support zone or a breakdown beneath the reclaimed descending trendline would signal weakness, potentially nullifying the bullish thesis.¬† Related Reading: Ethereum Macro Trend Oscillator Shows Green Might Be On The Horizon Such a move would suggest that the recent breakout was a false one, possibly a liquidity grab that could open the door to increased selling pressure. The analyst has suggested that traders should monitor price action around the $2,100 level. Until this invalidation point is reached, the analyst‚Äôs projected breakout, retest, and continuation scenario remains the dominant roadmap.
