I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:26:48.225644+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:45:53.710510+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:52:02.260841+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:12:48.365447+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:40:14.850692+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000?. Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal juncture after days of consistent selling pressure that have pushed the price down by more than 12% since last Tuesday. Currently hovering around the $2,400 mark, ETH is struggling to maintain bullish momentum, and many analysts warn that a deeper correction could follow if bulls fail to defend this crucial support zone. The recent drop reflects broader market uncertainty, with rising volatility shaking investor confidence just as ETH appeared ready to join a wider altcoin breakout. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours Despite this weakness, there’s growing optimism in some corners of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis showing that a Golden Cross has been confirmed on Ethereum’s 12-hour chart — a signal traditionally viewed as a precursor to major bullish moves. This crossover, which occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average, often marks the beginning of an extended uptrend. If bulls manage to hold current levels and reclaim higher resistance near $2,600, the Golden Cross could become a turning point. Until then, the coming days will be critical in determining whether Ethereum can bounce or sink into a longer consolidation phase. Volatility Hits Ethereum Amid Golden Cross Signal Ethereum saw sharp volatility over the weekend, surging past $2,550 before rapidly reversing and falling back into the $2,400 zone within hours. This sudden move has sparked renewed uncertainty, as analysts grow cautious about the fading bullish momentum and rising selling pressure. While ETH remains one of the stronger performers in the broader altcoin market, it is still down 36% from its December high of around $4,100. This leaves bulls with a clear challenge: hold current levels and regain control by pushing prices above $2,800 to ignite a sustained rally. The $2,400 level is now acting as a critical support zone. A break below it could trigger a deeper retracement, likely dragging Ethereum into a consolidation range or even toward lower support levels. Still, technical signals offer a glimmer of hope. According to Pillows, Ethereum recently confirmed a Golden Cross on the 12-hour chart — a bullish pattern that occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average. Historically, such signals have preceded strong upside moves, and Pillow believes this one could pave the way for Ethereum to reach $3,000 in the near term. However, for that to happen, buyers must step in decisively. Volume has tapered off, and sentiment appears fragile after last week&#8217;s breakdown. If bulls can defend the $2,400 region and reclaim higher resistance quickly, the Golden Cross might mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next leg up. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode, watching whether the bullish signal can outweigh the growing pressure from sellers. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound ETH Tests Key Support After Drop From Local Highs Ethereum is trading at $2,402 after a sharp Sunday sell-off, where the price spiked to $2,670 before retracing more than 10% in less than 24 hours. As seen in the 4-hour chart, ETH is now consolidating right above the $2,390–$2,400 zone, a level that is proving critical for bulls to hold. This area coincides with a prior consolidation zone and could act as a short-term support base. The 200-period EMA on the 4H chart is currently at $2,130, and the 200 SMA is near $1,991 — both are significantly below the current price and offer long-term trend support. However, the volume profile shows a spike in sell-side activity during the pullback, suggesting that short-term traders are locking in profits. If price breaks below $2,390, a deeper retrace toward the $2,200–$2,300 range becomes likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform On the upside, ETH must reclaim $2,550 to reestablish momentum. Failure to do so could confirm a local top. The price action is clearly indecisive, and this range-bound structure could persist unless bulls reassert strength with a decisive move above $2,600. Until then, the $2,400 level remains a battleground between buyers and sellers amid elevated volatility. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0659463118580765,

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent?. The Dogecoin price could be at a critical juncture for a breakout but momentum needs to persist. On the four-hour chart shared by analyst Josh Olszewicz, price has been sliding inside a clearly defined falling-wedge formation since printing a local high at $0.25941 on 13 May. The upper and lower boundaries of that wedge continue to drift lower, trapping successive swing highs and lows; the lower rail is presently guiding support at while the upper rail caps the market near $0.219. Within that compression, Olszewicz overlays an Ichimoku system set to short-cycle parameters (20/60/120/30). The most recent completed candle — stamped 17 May 08:00 UTC — settled at $0.21532 after trading between $0.21187 and $0.21676. That close left price lodged squarely inside the cloud, a location that typically denotes equilibrium. Internally, the Tenkan-sen rests at $0.21427, the Kijun-sen at $0.22524, Senkou Span A at $0.22102 and Senkou Span B at $0.21184, creating an unusually tight band of short-term reference levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tops Tend To Follow Surges In Retail Futures Activity, Analysis Shows The zone between the wedge floor and Span B around $0.212–0.214 forms a high-confluence support zone that has already produced two intraday rebounds. Conversely, the Kijun-sen and descending wedge resistance intersect near $0.225, erecting an equally visible ceiling overhead. As long as price remains trapped between those two lines, momentum traders are likely to see a low-volatility coil; the first decisive breach — particularly a four-hour close through the upper rail — would satisfy every textbook criterion for a bullish falling-wedge resolution and mechanically projects a return toward the 13 May high. Dogecoin Looks Still Strong Cantonese Cat’s weekly perspective speaks to a larger cycle. In his chart, Dogecoin has just finished its first weekly close above the Bull Market Support Band — essentially the 20-week simple moving average enveloped by a two-sigma envelope — since early February. That band currently spans $0.21617 at the lower edge to $0.22378 at the upper edge; last week’s candle settled at $0.22387, a whisker above the cap, converting what had been resistance throughout the spring into provisional support. The break occurs while the Bollinger upper band is still descending from the February crest near $0.35, an indication that volatility on the weekly time-frame has only just begun to contract after a multi-month bear unwind. The midline of the Bollinger structure, identical to the 20-week SMA and the top of the Bull Market Support Band, is therefore the single most important pivot for the week ahead. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target A second consecutive weekly settlement above $0.22378 would confirm the first as more than a one-off spike and could embolden trend-followers to price in a medium-term push toward the mid-$0.30s where the upper band presently curves. Taken together, the two time-frames sketch a clear roadmap. Short-term traders will be looking for a resolution of the descending wedge; a bullish breakout through $0.219 would immediately shift focus to prior supply at $0.24-0.26, whereas a failure to hold $0.205 risks an acceleration toward the April pivot at $0.185. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.217. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0654393939393939,

2025-05-20T16:21:40.043339+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $165 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Recovers Above $165 Solana price formed a base above the $160 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL gained pace for a move above the $162 and $165 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $172 resistance zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low is acting as a resistance. Solana is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $172 level. The next major resistance is near the $176 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $168 zone. The first major support is near the $165 level. A break below the $165 level might send the price toward the $162 zone. If there is a close below the $162 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

2025-05-20T16:27:28.779187+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T16:52:55.732505+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T17:18:47.910595+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

2025-05-20T17:37:05.570475+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result.

If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7.

Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,
