I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:26:48.225644+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:45:53.710510+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:52:02.260841+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:12:48.365447+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:40:14.850692+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000?. Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal juncture after days of consistent selling pressure that have pushed the price down by more than 12% since last Tuesday. Currently hovering around the $2,400 mark, ETH is struggling to maintain bullish momentum, and many analysts warn that a deeper correction could follow if bulls fail to defend this crucial support zone. The recent drop reflects broader market uncertainty, with rising volatility shaking investor confidence just as ETH appeared ready to join a wider altcoin breakout. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours Despite this weakness, there’s growing optimism in some corners of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis showing that a Golden Cross has been confirmed on Ethereum’s 12-hour chart — a signal traditionally viewed as a precursor to major bullish moves. This crossover, which occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average, often marks the beginning of an extended uptrend. If bulls manage to hold current levels and reclaim higher resistance near $2,600, the Golden Cross could become a turning point. Until then, the coming days will be critical in determining whether Ethereum can bounce or sink into a longer consolidation phase. Volatility Hits Ethereum Amid Golden Cross Signal Ethereum saw sharp volatility over the weekend, surging past $2,550 before rapidly reversing and falling back into the $2,400 zone within hours. This sudden move has sparked renewed uncertainty, as analysts grow cautious about the fading bullish momentum and rising selling pressure. While ETH remains one of the stronger performers in the broader altcoin market, it is still down 36% from its December high of around $4,100. This leaves bulls with a clear challenge: hold current levels and regain control by pushing prices above $2,800 to ignite a sustained rally. The $2,400 level is now acting as a critical support zone. A break below it could trigger a deeper retracement, likely dragging Ethereum into a consolidation range or even toward lower support levels. Still, technical signals offer a glimmer of hope. According to Pillows, Ethereum recently confirmed a Golden Cross on the 12-hour chart — a bullish pattern that occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average. Historically, such signals have preceded strong upside moves, and Pillow believes this one could pave the way for Ethereum to reach $3,000 in the near term. However, for that to happen, buyers must step in decisively. Volume has tapered off, and sentiment appears fragile after last week&#8217;s breakdown. If bulls can defend the $2,400 region and reclaim higher resistance quickly, the Golden Cross might mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next leg up. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode, watching whether the bullish signal can outweigh the growing pressure from sellers. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound ETH Tests Key Support After Drop From Local Highs Ethereum is trading at $2,402 after a sharp Sunday sell-off, where the price spiked to $2,670 before retracing more than 10% in less than 24 hours. As seen in the 4-hour chart, ETH is now consolidating right above the $2,390–$2,400 zone, a level that is proving critical for bulls to hold. This area coincides with a prior consolidation zone and could act as a short-term support base. The 200-period EMA on the 4H chart is currently at $2,130, and the 200 SMA is near $1,991 — both are significantly below the current price and offer long-term trend support. However, the volume profile shows a spike in sell-side activity during the pullback, suggesting that short-term traders are locking in profits. If price breaks below $2,390, a deeper retrace toward the $2,200–$2,300 range becomes likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform On the upside, ETH must reclaim $2,550 to reestablish momentum. Failure to do so could confirm a local top. The price action is clearly indecisive, and this range-bound structure could persist unless bulls reassert strength with a decisive move above $2,600. Until then, the $2,400 level remains a battleground between buyers and sellers amid elevated volatility. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0659463118580765,

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent?. The Dogecoin price could be at a critical juncture for a breakout but momentum needs to persist. On the four-hour chart shared by analyst Josh Olszewicz, price has been sliding inside a clearly defined falling-wedge formation since printing a local high at $0.25941 on 13 May. The upper and lower boundaries of that wedge continue to drift lower, trapping successive swing highs and lows; the lower rail is presently guiding support at while the upper rail caps the market near $0.219. Within that compression, Olszewicz overlays an Ichimoku system set to short-cycle parameters (20/60/120/30). The most recent completed candle — stamped 17 May 08:00 UTC — settled at $0.21532 after trading between $0.21187 and $0.21676. That close left price lodged squarely inside the cloud, a location that typically denotes equilibrium. Internally, the Tenkan-sen rests at $0.21427, the Kijun-sen at $0.22524, Senkou Span A at $0.22102 and Senkou Span B at $0.21184, creating an unusually tight band of short-term reference levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tops Tend To Follow Surges In Retail Futures Activity, Analysis Shows The zone between the wedge floor and Span B around $0.212–0.214 forms a high-confluence support zone that has already produced two intraday rebounds. Conversely, the Kijun-sen and descending wedge resistance intersect near $0.225, erecting an equally visible ceiling overhead. As long as price remains trapped between those two lines, momentum traders are likely to see a low-volatility coil; the first decisive breach — particularly a four-hour close through the upper rail — would satisfy every textbook criterion for a bullish falling-wedge resolution and mechanically projects a return toward the 13 May high. Dogecoin Looks Still Strong Cantonese Cat’s weekly perspective speaks to a larger cycle. In his chart, Dogecoin has just finished its first weekly close above the Bull Market Support Band — essentially the 20-week simple moving average enveloped by a two-sigma envelope — since early February. That band currently spans $0.21617 at the lower edge to $0.22378 at the upper edge; last week’s candle settled at $0.22387, a whisker above the cap, converting what had been resistance throughout the spring into provisional support. The break occurs while the Bollinger upper band is still descending from the February crest near $0.35, an indication that volatility on the weekly time-frame has only just begun to contract after a multi-month bear unwind. The midline of the Bollinger structure, identical to the 20-week SMA and the top of the Bull Market Support Band, is therefore the single most important pivot for the week ahead. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target A second consecutive weekly settlement above $0.22378 would confirm the first as more than a one-off spike and could embolden trend-followers to price in a medium-term push toward the mid-$0.30s where the upper band presently curves. Taken together, the two time-frames sketch a clear roadmap. Short-term traders will be looking for a resolution of the descending wedge; a bullish breakout through $0.219 would immediately shift focus to prior supply at $0.24-0.26, whereas a failure to hold $0.205 risks an acceleration toward the April pivot at $0.185. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.217. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0654393939393939,

2025-05-20T16:21:40.043339+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $165 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Recovers Above $165 Solana price formed a base above the $160 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL gained pace for a move above the $162 and $165 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $172 resistance zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low is acting as a resistance. Solana is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $172 level. The next major resistance is near the $176 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $168 zone. The first major support is near the $165 level. A break below the $165 level might send the price toward the $162 zone. If there is a close below the $162 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

2025-05-20T16:27:28.779187+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T16:52:55.732505+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T17:18:47.910595+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

2025-05-20T17:37:05.570475+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T18:59:34.361164+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T18:59:34.361164+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T19:03:04.701220+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T19:03:04.701220+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T19:12:26.764424+00:00,Ethereum,Reddit,"Ethereum (ETH) Throughput Is Going Parabolic - 78.82M Gas/sec Proves Scaling Is No Longer Just a Theory

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T19:12:26.764424+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

All of us have a price in mind that would carve us out of the crypto markets and into lavish living (though there are no doubt some who think bitcoin will matter in a post-electric world and that electronic currency will somehow outlast physical currency and the concept of trade). With World War 3 approaching swiftly with America's swan dive into fascism, what is your exit number? From an actual value-behind-the-currency, we've already seen the USD get downgraded as the world finally realizes that ""vibes""are not a long-store of value.

2025-05-20T20:45:01.205675+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T20:45:01.205675+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices.

2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T21:45:01.761114+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T21:45:01.761114+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T22:45:01.975871+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist.

ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-21T00:45:10.100895+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-21T00:45:10.100895+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious.

2025-05-21T02:45:02.605584+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum’s Revenge: Arthur Hayes Predicts Run To $10,000. In a macro-focused interview with the Bankless podcast, Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO and current Maelstrom CIO, laid out his bullish thesis on Ethereum, arguing that a move to $10,000 or even $15,000 is a realistic outcome as global liquidity shifts and capital controls take hold in the next monetary regime. Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,” he said. “It’s just human nature.” For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running&#8230; it was time.” Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. “It’s great it’s going up, but okay—let’s talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let’s talk when it’s meaningful.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum’s rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary “phase shift”—a transition away from the US Treasury as the world’s reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. “They print the money,” he said bluntly. “And the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.” Still, Ethereum’s path won’t be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH’s underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH’s moment is coming—particularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 – Here’s Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. “If you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,” he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is “a hard slog” now—yet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. “Mailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it&#8217;s physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That&#8217;s it,” Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there’s even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE 🔥#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout💹 The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next… pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it’s still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn’t spiked yet, so the setup isn’t sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There&#8217;s no way I couldn&#8217;t take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv — Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a “twofold rally” from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That’s about 114% higher. He’s confident there’s “no way you won’t take a Dogecoin trade” if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‑and‑shoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that’s capped gains since December’s $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42–$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100–104% jump from today’s price. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1057779275232105,

2025-05-21T05:45:01.770454+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 – Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming?. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the $2,500 mark, signs of market exhaustion are beginning to emerge. Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH’s total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble&#8217;s size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups &#8211; Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum’s ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset&#8217;s market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum&#8217;s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum’s impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset’s future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH’s 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ​​In another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle’s upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum’s daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant, X, and TradingView.com",0.0935912698412698,

2025-05-21T05:45:01.770454+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest. Dogecoin has entered a critical phase as it consolidates below the $0.26 resistance level, facing rising pressure after a sharp rejection last week. Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T06:45:01.817702+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest. Dogecoin has entered a critical phase as it consolidates below the $0.26 resistance level, facing rising pressure after a sharp rejection last week. Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T09:45:01.232088+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T10:45:01.737885+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm.

Hi everyone! I’m Negmat from Tajikistan. My real name and photos are open in Telegram—you can ask me anything. English isn’t my first language, but I do my best and write with a translator so people anywhere in the world can understand.

In the previous articles, I explained that CITU isn’t just a coin. It’s an experiment: can we put the ideas of Mises, Hayek, Friedman, and the Austrian school into practice—so anyone can see how economic theory works in reality?

**Why We Left Classic Bitcoin Behind**

When we first launched CITU, we used the classic Bitcoin difficulty algorithm. It was honest: if a big miner showed up, difficulty shot up; if they left, the network would get “stuck,” miners would leave, and monopoly only got worse. Volatility was huge. That’s why we switched to a hybrid model, where the market itself determines the difficulty—if you’re ready to take more risk, you get more, and if you want stability, you can still participate.

**How Staking Really Works in CITU—and Why It’s Not a “Deposit”**

In CITU, staking isn’t about earning interest on your deposit. Coins give you “points” that boost your chances of winning a block, but it’s not simple: the first point costs 1.1 coins, the second 2.1, the third 4.1, the fourth 8.1, and so on (maximum is 30 points). If you have 6.1 coins, that’s 3 points; if you have 10 coins, it’s still only 3 points—the rest are just sitting there, so it’s better to either sell them or buy up to the next point threshold.

This creates a dynamic: when the price rises, people sell off extra coins; if it falls, they buy the missing coins to reach the next point. This really smooths out volatility, helps stabilize price, and at the same time, protects the network.

**Transaction Points—A Real Incentive for Miners**

The second key thing: miners also get points for transactions. Every time a block includes, say, 1,000 coins of transfers, that brings the miner extra points: the first point is for 0.11 coins, the second for 0.21, the third for 0.41, etc. But transaction points can never exceed staking points—this is on purpose, to encourage staking and keep the network active. So a miner isn’t just motivated to hold coins, but to collect and include as many transactions as possible. The network is working, and you can see it directly in the blocks.

**How Randomness Defends Against Monopoly**

One more feature—randomness for every block. It’s calculated from the block’s hash (from 0 to 170), with the hash as the seed, so for any given block, you’ll always get the same “random” value. This protects the network from centralization: even if you have huge computing power, there’s always a chance someone else can win the block. That really makes the game fair for everyone.

**Why CITU Is Truly Rare and Stable**

— There will only ever be 226 million coins, each divisible down to 0.01—so the real “pennies” over all time are even fewer than with Bitcoin.  
— Inflation goes down every year; in 10 years, it’ll be just 0.17–0.25%. No “inflationary” coin can promise that.  
— History shows: after moving to this algorithm, the price became much more stable, and it’s all thanks to mechanisms that the Austrian school theorized about years ago.

**Why I’m Telling You All This**

I’m not here to “sell” a coin. I want you to see: if you don’t interfere, economic ideas work in practice. If you have questions, ask away—I’m always open to dialogue, and my real identity is open.

2025-05-21T12:45:02.158249+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

**Part 3. Why Staking and Transaction Points in CITU Aren’t About “Interest”—They’re About Stability and a Fair Game**

Hi everyone! I’m Negmat from Tajikistan. My real name and photos are open in Telegram—you can ask me anything. English isn’t my first language, but I do my best and write with a translator so people anywhere in the world can understand.

ETH is now rising and might aim for a move above the $2,580 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,480 and $2,500 levels. The price is trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain strength if it clears the $2,585 resistance in the near term. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ethereum price started a downside correction below the $2,500 level, unlike Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,480 and $2,460 support levels. However, the bulls were active near the $2,450 zone. A low was formed at $2,445 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $2,480 and $2,500 levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,588 swing high to the $2,445 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,500 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,555 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,588 swing high to the $2,445 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,585 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,620 level. A clear move above the $2,620 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T14:45:01.471688+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"Part 3. Why Staking and Transaction Points in CITU Aren’t About “Interest”—They’re About Stability and a Fair Game

**Part 3. Why Staking and Transaction Points in CITU Aren’t About “Interest”—They’re About Stability and a Fair Game**

Hi everyone! I’m Negmat from Tajikistan. My real name and photos are open in Telegram—you can ask me anything. English isn’t my first language, but I do my best and write with a translator so people anywhere in the world can understand.

In the previous articles, I explained that CITU isn’t just a coin. It’s an experiment: can we put the ideas of Mises, Hayek, Friedman, and the Austrian school into practice—so anyone can see how economic theory works in reality?

**Why We Left Classic Bitcoin Behind**

When we first launched CITU, we used the classic Bitcoin difficulty algorithm. It was honest: if a big miner showed up, difficulty shot up; if they left, the network would get “stuck,” miners would leave, and monopoly only got worse. Volatility was huge. That’s why we switched to a hybrid model, where the market itself determines the difficulty—if you’re ready to take more risk, you get more, and if you want stability, you can still participate.

**How Staking Really Works in CITU—and Why It’s Not a “Deposit”**

In CITU, staking isn’t about earning interest on your deposit. Coins give you “points” that boost your chances of winning a block, but it’s not simple: the first point costs 1.1 coins, the second 2.1, the third 4.1, the fourth 8.1, and so on (maximum is 30 points). If you have 6.1 coins, that’s 3 points; if you have 10 coins, it’s still only 3 points—the rest are just sitting there, so it’s better to either sell them or buy up to the next point threshold.

This creates a dynamic: when the price rises, people sell off extra coins; if it falls, they buy the missing coins to reach the next point. This really smooths out volatility, helps stabilize price, and at the same time, protects the network.

**Transaction Points—A Real Incentive for Miners**

The second key thing: miners also get points for transactions. Every time a block includes, say, 1,000 coins of transfers, that brings the miner extra points: the first point is for 0.11 coins, the second for 0.21, the third for 0.41, etc. But transaction points can never exceed staking points—this is on purpose, to encourage staking and keep the network active. So a miner isn’t just motivated to hold coins, but to collect and include as many transactions as possible. The network is working, and you can see it directly in the blocks.

**How Randomness Defends Against Monopoly**

One more feature—randomness for every block. It’s calculated from the block’s hash (from 0 to 170), with the hash as the seed, so for any given block, you’ll always get the same “random” value. This protects the network from centralization: even if you have huge computing power, there’s always a chance someone else can win the block. That really makes the game fair for everyone.

**Why CITU Is Truly Rare and Stable**

— There will only ever be 226 million coins, each divisible down to 0.01—so the real “pennies” over all time are even fewer than with Bitcoin.  
— Inflation goes down every year; in 10 years, it’ll be just 0.17–0.25%. No “inflationary” coin can promise that.  
— History shows: after moving to this algorithm, the price became much more stable, and it’s all thanks to mechanisms that the Austrian school theorized about years ago.

**Why I’m Telling You All This**

I’m not here to “sell” a coin. I want you to see: if you don’t interfere, economic ideas work in practice. If you have questions, ask away—I’m always open to dialogue, and my real identity is open.

This whole process is fucking convoluted and searching for answers leads me in circles.

I have pull up the Reddit Vault in Metamask (While having Arbitrum Nova selected)... I can see my moons.  If I choose Arbitrum One, then I can't see the Moons.  Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,

Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

This whole process is fucking convoluted and searching for answers leads me in circles.

I have pull up the Reddit Vault in Metamask (While having Arbitrum Nova selected)... I can see my moons.  If I choose Arbitrum One, then I can't see the Moons.  Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,
2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 – Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming?. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the $2,500 mark, signs of market exhaustion are beginning to emerge. Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH’s total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble&#8217;s size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups &#8211; Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum’s ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset&#8217;s market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum&#8217;s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum’s impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset’s future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH’s 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ​​In another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle’s upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum’s daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant, X, and TradingView.com",0.0935912698412698,
2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T15:45:01.950204+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,
2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Volume has decreased slightly since the early May breakout, hinting at possible exhaustion or consolidation before another leg.

2025-05-21T16:45:01.359966+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,

On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn.

2025-05-21T17:45:01.825195+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T17:45:01.825195+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Volume has decreased slightly since the early May breakout, hinting at possible exhaustion or consolidation before another leg.

2025-05-21T17:45:01.825195+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

2025-05-21T19:03:05.060745+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage.

2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,
2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Volume has decreased slightly since the early May breakout, hinting at possible exhaustion or consolidation before another leg.

2025-05-21T19:45:09.347497+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T20:45:01.393562+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

Hi,

A couple years ago I bought this token called MarketMove (https://app.marketmove.ai/)  which later on around early 2024 if im not mistaken) migrated to Fastlane (https://fastlane.foundation/). Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

FastLane's token is on Solana



We finally then did the migration, but the tokens never showed up on my wallet, on Solana's network(?)",0.06875,

Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

2025-05-21T22:45:02.074296+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T22:45:02.074296+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly.

According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-21T23:45:01.435440+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

Hi,

A couple years ago I bought this token called MarketMove (https://app.marketmove.ai/)  which later on around early 2024 if im not mistaken) migrated to Fastlane (https://fastlane.foundation/). Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

FastLane's token is on Solana



We finally then did the migration, but the tokens never showed up on my wallet, on Solana's network(?)",0.06875,

Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

2025-05-22T01:45:01.559032+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year. Solana is trading at a critical level as the broader crypto market consolidates below key resistance zones. After an impressive 90% surge since early April, SOL has experienced a modest pullback, sparking speculation that this may be the final dip before a significant move higher. While many assets are struggling to maintain momentum, Solana has shown remarkable strength and resilience, bolstering bullish expectations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest Top analyst Cas Abbe shared a technical view suggesting that the long-term bullish structure for Solana remains firmly intact. According to Abbe, last month’s retest of the multi-year trendline marked a pivotal moment for the asset, reinforcing support and resetting sentiment for a potential continuation. Since the bounce from that level, SOL has continued to climb steadily, and many now believe that Solana is gearing up for another leg up. With fundamentals improving and historical patterns pointing to renewed upside, the market is watching closely. A successful reclaim of nearby resistance levels could be the trigger that drives Solana back toward its previous all-time high—and potentially beyond. For now, SOL holders are eyeing this consolidation phase as the calm before the storm. Solana Holds Critical Support As Market Eyes Bullish Continuation Solana is testing a crucial demand zone around the $165 level, attempting to establish a foundation for its next major move. This range has become a key battleground between bulls and bears, especially as broader market sentiment is shaped by Bitcoin’s struggle to push past its all-time high. With BTC stalling just below $109K, uncertainty clouds the outlook for many altcoins, including SOL. However, Solana continues to show signs of relative strength. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall trend for Solana remains bullish. According to Abbe, the asset’s multi-year uptrend remains intact. Last month, Solana successfully retested its long-term trendline, which Abbe believes marked the bottom of the recent correction. Since that bounce, SOL has surged over 50%, demonstrating strong investor confidence and solid underlying momentum. Abbe maintains that the $290 high seen earlier was not the final peak for Solana, projecting a new all-time high sometime in 2025. His bullish thesis is supported by improving fundamentals across the Solana ecosystem, including rising developer activity, growing DeFi participation, and increasing on-chain usage. Related Reading: Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key SOL Price Analysis: Holding The Line Before A Big Move Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $167.76 after a sharp rally in early May that pushed the price above both the 200-day EMA and 200-day SMA. The chart shows SOL climbing over 90% since its April low, confirming bullish momentum and renewed interest across the market. However, the price is now stalling just below the 200-day SMA at $181.03, which is acting as dynamic resistance. The key support lies near the 200-day EMA at $162.55. As long as SOL holds this level, the short-term structure remains bullish. A clean break above the $181 level would open the door for a move toward the psychological $200 mark and potentially higher. But if bears regain control and price breaks below $160, the uptrend could be in jeopardy.

2025-05-22T01:45:01.559032+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Bollinger Squeeze Signals ‘Huge Move’ Ahead, Analyst Warns. In a fresh 12-hour chart shared on X, independent technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) underscores what he calls a “Bollinger Band squeeze” on Dogecoin, hinting that volatility could be about to erupt. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Hint At ‘Huge Move’ The chart, captured at 03:54 UTC on May 21, fixes the memecoin at $0.22967 while the 20-period simple moving average (the Bollinger basis) tracks marginally lower at $0.22717. The upper and lower bands are parked at $0.24260 and $0.21175 respectively, compressing the trading envelope to barely three US cents and leaving just a 13.6% gap between the extremes—its tightest spread since early April’s doldrums. The chart lays out a clear chronology of volatility expansion and subsequent contraction. From May 6 onward Dogecoin erupted out of a month-long base, sprinting from the mid-$0.16 zone to print a local peak roughly at $0.26. That impulse detonated the bands to their widest reading in six weeks. Since then, the DOGE price has traced a shallow pull-back but—importantly—has not surrendered the 20-SMA. Each dip into the mid-$0.21 area has been absorbed, carving out progressively higher lows and turning the mid-band into dynamic support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst With the bands now coiling, traders are eyeing the inflection points telegraphed by the indicator. A decisive 12-hour settlement beyond the upper rail at $0.243 would release price into open air, exposing the recent swing high at $0.27 and, beyond that. Conversely, a candle body punched through the lower rail at $0.212 would nullify the short-term bullish structure and likely drag Dogecoin toward the psychological $0.20 handle and May’s value area near $0.16. Until either threshold gives way, the squeeze itself remains the story. “Bollinger band squeezing, getting ready for the next huge move,” the analyst writes fittingly. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? DOGE Channel Breakout Is Brewing Shifting up to the one-day view, Dogecoin’s action since the November-2024 peak is contained by a broad descending channel whose ceiling now descends through the $0.24 corridor. Price is camped directly beneath that upper rail at $0.231, an area that also coincides almost to the cent with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the full November-high–to–mid-March-low leg ($0.234). The confluence creates a technically potent lid: a daily close above it would not only mark the first breach of the seven-month channel but would simultaneously reclaim the “golden ratio,” an event that historically invites trend acceleration. If bulls can force settlement north of the overhead trendline and the 0.618 Fib, the next magnet resides at the 0.5 retracement ($0.2824). Beyond that, the 0.382 level at $0.3300 and the 0.236 at $0.3890 bracket the higher targets inside the channel’s former interior. Failure here would leave a well-defined support ladder: the 200-day EMA at $0.217, the 100-day at $0.207, and the cluster around the 0.786 Fib at $0.1669. Only a decisive break of those shelves would re-energise bears sufficient to revisit the March capitulation trough at $0.13.

2025-05-22T02:45:01.940424+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana’s BONK Targets 77% Corrective Move After Retrace To 200 EMA. BONK&#8217;s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level.  This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin, Analyst Says Solana Meme Coin “BONK” Is About To Explode Interestingly, this movement has led to a consolidation between these levels since May 15, and according to the TradingView analyst, the price structure suggests buyers are stepping in to defend the trend. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a higher low.  From a volume standpoint, each upward impulse has shown rising volume since the first week of April. However, the recent decline occurred on diminishing volume, hinting at exhaustion from sellers.  77% Upside Move If BONK Breaks Above Resistance Even with the current range, BONK is still within a bullish setup that could send it towards a new 2025 high and possibly towards its current all-time high levels. The important level to watch now is the point of control (POC) resistance at approximately $0.00001955. This level previously acted as the pivot point before the pullback and now serves as the threshold for bullish continuation.  Related Reading: This Dogecoin Rival Is Set For An Over 100% Pump – It’s Not Shiba Inu A confirmed close above this region would likely trigger a rapid expansion move toward the next resistance cluster around $0.00002581, before eventually reaching the predicted price target of $0.00003243, which would bring it close to its January 2025 open of $0.000035. As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor. If buyers manage to maintain pressure and secure a decisive breakout, the stage could be set for a strong rally into the upper resistance band and a retest of BONK’s 2025 swing high.

2025-05-22T03:45:01.389687+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Token migration help

Hi,

A couple years ago I bought this token called MarketMove (https://app.marketmove.ai/)  which later on around early 2024 if im not mistaken) migrated to Fastlane (https://fastlane.foundation/). Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.


Bare with me because I'm completely clueless to any of this crypto stuff.


I had a friend of mine who I trust, help me with the process. Old tokens were on TrustWallet, which was not supported by marketmove's site to do the migration process, so we moved them to Metamask (which was one of the wallets supported)

FastLane's token is on Solana



We finally then did the migration, but the tokens never showed up on my wallet, on Solana's network(?)",0.06875,
2025-05-22T03:45:01.389687+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana’s BONK Targets 77% Corrective Move After Retrace To 200 EMA. BONK&#8217;s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level.  This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin, Analyst Says Solana Meme Coin “BONK” Is About To Explode Interestingly, this movement has led to a consolidation between these levels since May 15, and according to the TradingView analyst, the price structure suggests buyers are stepping in to defend the trend. This, in turn, has led to the formation of a higher low.  From a volume standpoint, each upward impulse has shown rising volume since the first week of April. However, the recent decline occurred on diminishing volume, hinting at exhaustion from sellers.  77% Upside Move If BONK Breaks Above Resistance Even with the current range, BONK is still within a bullish setup that could send it towards a new 2025 high and possibly towards its current all-time high levels. The important level to watch now is the point of control (POC) resistance at approximately $0.00001955. This level previously acted as the pivot point before the pullback and now serves as the threshold for bullish continuation.  Related Reading: This Dogecoin Rival Is Set For An Over 100% Pump – It’s Not Shiba Inu A confirmed close above this region would likely trigger a rapid expansion move toward the next resistance cluster around $0.00002581, before eventually reaching the predicted price target of $0.00003243, which would bring it close to its January 2025 open of $0.000035. As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor. If buyers manage to maintain pressure and secure a decisive breakout, the stage could be set for a strong rally into the upper resistance band and a retest of BONK’s 2025 swing high.

Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections. It also aligns with a daily support zone around $0.00001832 to $0.00001841 and a resistance zone around $0.00002034.

As such, the projected target if this plays out will translate to a 77% rally. The price target also aligns with a previous swing high on January 15 and January 18. At the time of writing, BONK is trading at $0.00001995, up by 1,6% in the past 24 hours. Its reaction here, just above the POC resistance, will be an important deciding factor.

Since then I completely forgot about it and never migrated, until yesterday when I remembered that I still had the old tokens and tried to do it.

BONK&#8217;s price action has been back and forth in May, and the cryptocurrency is now essentially back where it started the month. Recent price action reveals that the token is attempting to stabilize at around the 200 EMA after being rejected by the local high near the 0.00002581 level.  This rejection led to a measured pullback towards $0.00001820. However, according to a technical analysis on the TradingView platform, the retrace appears to be forming a bullish continuation setup with a 77% corrective move in view rather than indicating a bearish reversal. Bullish Market Structure Holds Firm For BONK BONK’s price retracement has brought it directly into a zone of heavy technical interest. At the heart of this confluence lies the 200 EMA on the 4-hour timeframe, which could technically serve as the next support zone for the meme coin moving forward. In addition, the retracement aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is commonly associated with bullish corrections.

2025-05-22T13:45:01.998779+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"The Ultimate Irony: The Fiat System May Soon Be “Backed” by Crypto

We’re about to witness something beautifully ironic.

With stablecoin legislation gaining momentum, the U.S. dollar may soon be propped up—not by gold, not by productivity, not by sound monetary policy—but by stablecoins. That’s right: the very crypto instruments they once dismissed as dangerous could soon be the duct tape holding together a rapidly decaying fiat system.

Think about it. The dollar has been steadily bleeding purchasing power for decades, a direct result of Keynesian economic dogma and the fiat system’s built-in design flaw: eventual failure. But instead of fixing the fundamentals, the system is now pivoting to crypto… to back itself.

Tether, USDC, and others are becoming lifeboats lashed to the Titanic.

And while they might buy time, they won’t buy salvation. Stablecoins are still tethered (pun intended) to the same failing fiat they’re meant to reflect. They are not the endgame.

Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is the ultimate black hole of value—silent, patient, inevitable. People don’t just use it; they hodl it. And as more fiat is digitized and funneled through stablecoins, more value inevitably seeps toward the hardest asset ever discovered: BTC

So in an epic twist, the fiat system may extend its life by clinging to crypto rails… only to be slowly devoured by the very force it once tried to suppress.

The transfer of wealth has already begun. They just don’t realize they’re the liquidity exit.

2025-05-22T14:45:02.055460+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"The Ultimate Irony: The Fiat System May Soon Be “Backed” by Crypto

We’re about to witness something beautifully ironic.

With stablecoin legislation gaining momentum, the U.S. dollar may soon be propped up—not by gold, not by productivity, not by sound monetary policy—but by stablecoins. That’s right: the very crypto instruments they once dismissed as dangerous could soon be the duct tape holding together a rapidly decaying fiat system.

Think about it. The dollar has been steadily bleeding purchasing power for decades, a direct result of Keynesian economic dogma and the fiat system’s built-in design flaw: eventual failure. But instead of fixing the fundamentals, the system is now pivoting to crypto… to back itself.

Tether, USDC, and others are becoming lifeboats lashed to the Titanic.

And while they might buy time, they won’t buy salvation. Stablecoins are still tethered (pun intended) to the same failing fiat they’re meant to reflect. They are not the endgame.

Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is the ultimate black hole of value—silent, patient, inevitable. People don’t just use it; they hodl it. And as more fiat is digitized and funneled through stablecoins, more value inevitably seeps toward the hardest asset ever discovered: BTC

So in an epic twist, the fiat system may extend its life by clinging to crypto rails… only to be slowly devoured by the very force it once tried to suppress.

The transfer of wealth has already begun. They just don’t realize they’re the liquidity exit.

2025-05-22T15:45:02.186552+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.

Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure.

2025-05-22T17:45:07.672158+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.

2025-05-22T18:45:01.852314+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.

2025-05-22T19:03:04.636766+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure.

2025-05-22T19:45:01.230509+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure.

2025-05-22T19:45:01.230509+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.241. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0822471066348617,

2025-05-22T21:45:01.881748+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, the price is still within a consolidation range, and bulls must hold above $2,600 to maintain this breakout potential.

2025-05-22T21:45:01.881748+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it.

2025-05-22T23:45:01.797416+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, the price is still within a consolidation range, and bulls must hold above $2,600 to maintain this breakout potential.

2025-05-22T23:45:01.797416+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) reaffirmed his bullish outlook for Dogecoin, stating in a live stream that a surge to $1 is “absolutely” possible this cycle—provided a critical set of macro and market conditions fall into place. Kevin, a rising voice in crypto technical analysis, outlined his thesis in detail, highlighting Dogecoin’s resilience against Bitcoin and its technical structure as key signals of strength. “We were accumulating a spot position in the Patreon at 14 cents. I think the average is 15—right at 15 cents even,” he said. “Congratulations if you got into that play with me. Looking really, really nice.” The $1 Dogecoin Dream He pointed to Dogecoin’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and its current consolidation within a potential bull flag as technical proof that momentum is building—if Bitcoin cooperates. “If Bitcoin continues to break higher, then this will break higher,” Kev noted. “If Bitcoin fails, then this will not break higher. It will fail.” That correlation underpins Kev’s broader framework for altcoin evaluation, which puts Bitcoin’s macro structure and USDT dominance at the center of any serious analysis. “You don&#8217;t really want to be doing too much individual TA on altcoins when Bitcoin dominance is at 64%. You&#8217;re not going to get very accurate TA,” he said. Still, Dogecoin stands apart from the altcoin pack. Kev showed Doge/BTC strength as a key differentiator: “Doge versus BTC is holding up much better than a lot of other altcoins. Litecoin versus Bitcoin? Dying. UNI, AVAX, DOT, LINK—all dying. Doge is still holding up. That&#8217;s why I own it. That’s my baby right there.” As for the $1 price target, Kev didn’t mince words, but made it clear it’s not just about charts. “It actually would be pretty shocking if it didn’t hit a dollar—again, contingent on Bitcoin heading higher,” he said. “But you need a sustained bull run. You need good monetary policy. You need a good macroeconomic environment.” Kev criticized the simplistic analysis plaguing the crypto space, pushing back on the idea that Dogecoin will moon just because “this happened last cycle.” Instead, he emphasized the importance of understanding economic conditions, inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and liquidity access. “We’re coming out of a macro environment the likes we’ve never seen before,” he said, referencing the Fed’s historic post-COVID tightening cycle and the uncertainty introduced by new US trade tariffs. “Dogecoin can hit a dollar. However, would I say that we have the exact environment we want to say that’s a highly probable scenario? I’d say we’re getting there—but we need more.” He also downplayed the idea that a potential Dogecoin ETF approval would be a decisive catalyst, unless it happens during a full-blown bull market. “If it happens and everything’s quiet… it probably won’t do its thing,” he warned. “Crypto’s about timing.” In closing, Kev reiterated the disciplined mindset he teaches his community. “Don’t just pull up an altcoin chart and say, ‘Well, this bull flag says we’re going to 32 cents,’” he said. “Watch Bitcoin. Watch USDT dominance. Then look at your pairing charts. Only then should you touch the Doge/USD chart.” With a deeply technical roadmap, macroeconomic awareness, and a data-driven approach, Kev made one thing clear: Dogecoin’s path to $1 isn’t hopium—it’s a real possibility, if the market allows it. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.241. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0822471066348617,

I was at a dinner party when I casually mentioned that I held a decent amount of Ethereum, and the table—full of Bitcoin maxis—immediately burst into laughter. They started pointing out how Ethereum had become bloated, centralized, and a playground for pump-and-dump tokens. Then, one by one, they pulled out their cold wallets and flexed their BTC-only holdings like sacred relics.

They asked if I’d checked Ethereum’s gas fees lately, or how many L2s it takes to send $20, and someone even joked that ETH was the Yahoo of crypto. They then pulled up Ethereum’s price chart next to Bitcoin’s and erupted into another round of roaring laughter while making the “pinching fingers” (🤏) gesture to show how little ETH dominance remained.",-0.1401041666666666,

2025-05-23T01:45:01.883725+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, the price is still within a consolidation range, and bulls must hold above $2,600 to maintain this breakout potential.

2025-05-23T03:45:01.912063+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows  – Volatility Returns. Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,500 level after weeks of strong buying pressure and bullish momentum, despite having lost more than 60% of its value since December 2024. The asset’s resilience comes at a pivotal time: Bitcoin has officially broken its all-time high, triggering optimism that a new phase of the market cycle is beginning—one that could deliver explosive gains for altcoins. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year For Ethereum to fulfill its usual leadership role in an altcoin rally, it must break above current resistance zones and confirm a recovery structure. As price action continues to develop, analysts are watching closely for signals that ETH is ready to outperform once again. To illustrate just how deep the correction was, Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shared a key metric: after Ethereum’s sharp sell-off that began in December, the share of addresses in profit plunged from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. The rebound since then has been remarkable, but the road to a full recovery is still developing. If Ethereum can maintain support and reclaim higher levels, the stage may be set for a broader altseason that could reshape sentiment across the crypto market. Volatility Grows: Ethereum Eyes A Breakout Ethereum bulls have regained control after a turbulent few months, forming a bullish price structure as the asset attempts to reclaim the $2,700 level. The surge began with a clean breakout above $2,200, and despite recent volatility, Ethereum is showing signs of strength. On Sunday, ETH spiked above $2,550 before retracing to $2,400 in a sharp pullback. Since then, price action has stabilized, and with Bitcoin pushing into new all-time highs, Ethereum appears poised to follow. Analysts now expect a potential breakout if ETH can flip $2,700 into support. Momentum is building as selling pressure fades, and buyer confidence grows. Many view this as a key inflection point: if bulls sustain their push, Ethereum could reassert leadership in a market increasingly tilted toward altcoins. Supporting this bullish outlook is fresh on-chain data from Sentora. Following a brutal drawdown that began in December 2024, the percentage of ETH addresses in profit collapsed from over 90% to just 32% by April 2025. Since then, the recovery has been dramatic—nearly 60% of addresses are now back in profit. According to Sentora, this level of volatility hasn’t been seen since the explosive 2017 bull cycle. If Ethereum continues this trend and breaks out of its current range, it may not only confirm a strong recovery but also spark the next major leg of altseason. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst ETH Tests Critical Resistance Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal level, having surged to $2,687 with a 5.3% daily gain. The chart shows ETH challenging its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,702, a key technical barrier that has historically acted as resistance. After multiple failed attempts to break past this level in recent weeks, today’s bullish momentum puts ETH on the verge of a potential breakout. &#160; The bullish structure is supported by strong upward volume, signaling renewed buyer interest. Notably, the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $2,444, has provided solid support throughout May, creating a base for this upward push. If Ethereum decisively closes above the $2,700 region, it could set the stage for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, confirming a shift in trend after months of bearish pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, the price is still within a consolidation range, and bulls must hold above $2,600 to maintain this breakout potential.

Here&#8217;s where the target could lie, based on the pattern. Dogecoin Has Just Seen A Surge Beyond Bull Pennant Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has been forming in the hourly price of Dogecoin recently. The pattern in question is a &#8220;Bull Pennant,&#8221; which is a type of Pennant from technical analysis (TA). A Pennant forms whenever the price of an asset witnesses consolidation between two converging trendlines following a sharp move. The initial rapid move is known as the &#8216;pole,&#8217; and the consolidation channel as the &#8216;pennant.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet This arrangement is similar to that seen in Flag patterns, with the main difference between the two being the fact that Flags involve parallel consolidation channels, not triangular ones. Just like other consolidation patterns in TA, when the price is stuck inside the pennant portion, it is likely to face resistance at the upper level and support at the lower one. Pennants are usually considered continuation patterns, so a breakout is more probable to occur in the same direction as the preceding move (that is, the same orientation as the pole). When the pole is pointing in the up direction, the resulting Pennant is called a Bull Pennant. Similarly, it being in the opposite direction forms what&#8217;s known as a Bear Pennant. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Bull Pennant that the 1-hour Dogecoin price has potentially been trading inside recently: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin was witnessing net consolidation toward the downside inside this Bull Pennant earlier, but now, with the latest rally in the asset, its price has managed to find a break above the resistance line. So far, the memecoin hasn&#8217;t gained too much distance over the line, so it&#8217;s unconfirmed whether this is a real breakout. In the scenario that it is indeed the case and the governing pattern here is a Bull Pennant, then it&#8217;s possible that DOGE could end up seeing a rally of a similar scale as the pole of the pattern. The length of the pole involved in this Bull Pennant puts the breakout target at around $0.31.

2025-05-23T04:45:01.249292+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch. Ethereum is gaining momentum as optimism returns to the crypto market. With Bitcoin officially entering price discovery and surging past its all-time highs, attention is turning toward ETH, which is now testing critical resistance levels. Ethereum has gained over 55% since early May, riding the wave of broader market strength and renewed investor confidence. However, despite the impressive recovery, ETH still lags behind Bitcoin’s pace and has yet to reclaim its 2021 highs. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst Top analyst Daan shared a technical view highlighting that Ethereum has been chopping around the $2,400–$2,600 zone since its explosive move earlier this month. This range-bound price action signals indecision, as buyers remain active but haven’t yet triggered a breakout. Daan notes that although Bitcoin is showing strong leadership with its push into new highs, Ethereum’s performance in this phase has been more muted. Still, the setup remains constructive for bulls. The $2,400 level has acted as solid support, while resistance above $2,800 remains the next target to clear for continuation. As Bitcoin continues to lead, ETH could be next in line to surge—if it can escape this range and follow BTC’s lead into a new leg higher. All eyes are now on Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Altcoins Enter The Spotlight As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $111K, the broader crypto market appears to be entering a fresh phase of momentum, one that could drive massive gains across altcoins. Among them, Ethereum remains in a critical position. While ETH hasn’t followed BTC’s breakout just yet, it’s holding firmly above support and showing signs of building strength. To confirm a bullish continuation, ETH needs to break decisively above resistance and lead the altcoin rally. Daan shared a technical view highlighting that ETH has been consolidating between the $2,400 and $2,600 levels since its last squeeze higher. Despite Bitcoin’s explosive move, Ethereum is once again lagging, a dynamic that’s been reflected in a cooling ETH/BTC ratio. This underperformance has sparked debate among traders, with many waiting for ETH to catch up and drive the next altseason. Daan emphasized that the $2,500 zone has been well-defended by bulls, but ETH has yet to produce a convincing breakout. The key resistance level to watch is $2,850—clearing it would mark a technical shift toward higher highs. On the flip side, if ETH falls below $2,100, it could trigger a broader pullback. For now, ETH remains range-bound but poised, with market sentiment growing more optimistic by the day. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year ETH Tests Critical Price Levels Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength on the 4-hour chart, trading around $2,668 at the time of writing. After weeks of consolidation in the $2,400–$2,600 range, ETH has pushed toward the upper boundary of this zone, hinting at a possible breakout. The recent bounce from support around $2,450 has been strong, with consecutive green candles and rising volume signaling increasing bullish momentum. The 200-period SMA and EMA, currently at $2,077 and $2,1,99 respectively, are well below the current price, confirming a bullish market structure. ETH has held above both moving averages since early May, and the current price action appears to be building up pressure for a decisive move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, ETH must now break above $2,700 convincingly to confirm a breakout and signal a continuation toward higher resistance at $2,850 and beyond.

A breakout could trigger a rapid move to $3,000, while failure to hold current levels could drag ETH back toward its previous support.

I was at a dinner party when I casually mentioned that I held a decent amount of Ethereum, and the table—full of Bitcoin maxis—immediately burst into laughter. They started pointing out how Ethereum had become bloated, centralized, and a playground for pump-and-dump tokens. Then, one by one, they pulled out their cold wallets and flexed their BTC-only holdings like sacred relics.

They asked if I’d checked Ethereum’s gas fees lately, or how many L2s it takes to send $20, and someone even joked that ETH was the Yahoo of crypto. They then pulled up Ethereum’s price chart next to Bitcoin’s and erupted into another round of roaring laughter while making the “pinching fingers” (🤏) gesture to show how little ETH dominance remained.",-0.1401041666666666,
2025-05-23T05:45:01.868841+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch. Ethereum is gaining momentum as optimism returns to the crypto market. With Bitcoin officially entering price discovery and surging past its all-time highs, attention is turning toward ETH, which is now testing critical resistance levels. Ethereum has gained over 55% since early May, riding the wave of broader market strength and renewed investor confidence. However, despite the impressive recovery, ETH still lags behind Bitcoin’s pace and has yet to reclaim its 2021 highs. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst Top analyst Daan shared a technical view highlighting that Ethereum has been chopping around the $2,400–$2,600 zone since its explosive move earlier this month. This range-bound price action signals indecision, as buyers remain active but haven’t yet triggered a breakout. Daan notes that although Bitcoin is showing strong leadership with its push into new highs, Ethereum’s performance in this phase has been more muted. Still, the setup remains constructive for bulls. The $2,400 level has acted as solid support, while resistance above $2,800 remains the next target to clear for continuation. As Bitcoin continues to lead, ETH could be next in line to surge—if it can escape this range and follow BTC’s lead into a new leg higher. All eyes are now on Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Altcoins Enter The Spotlight As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $111K, the broader crypto market appears to be entering a fresh phase of momentum, one that could drive massive gains across altcoins. Among them, Ethereum remains in a critical position. While ETH hasn’t followed BTC’s breakout just yet, it’s holding firmly above support and showing signs of building strength. To confirm a bullish continuation, ETH needs to break decisively above resistance and lead the altcoin rally. Daan shared a technical view highlighting that ETH has been consolidating between the $2,400 and $2,600 levels since its last squeeze higher. Despite Bitcoin’s explosive move, Ethereum is once again lagging, a dynamic that’s been reflected in a cooling ETH/BTC ratio. This underperformance has sparked debate among traders, with many waiting for ETH to catch up and drive the next altseason. Daan emphasized that the $2,500 zone has been well-defended by bulls, but ETH has yet to produce a convincing breakout. The key resistance level to watch is $2,850—clearing it would mark a technical shift toward higher highs. On the flip side, if ETH falls below $2,100, it could trigger a broader pullback. For now, ETH remains range-bound but poised, with market sentiment growing more optimistic by the day. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year ETH Tests Critical Price Levels Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength on the 4-hour chart, trading around $2,668 at the time of writing. After weeks of consolidation in the $2,400–$2,600 range, ETH has pushed toward the upper boundary of this zone, hinting at a possible breakout. The recent bounce from support around $2,450 has been strong, with consecutive green candles and rising volume signaling increasing bullish momentum. The 200-period SMA and EMA, currently at $2,077 and $2,1,99 respectively, are well below the current price, confirming a bullish market structure. ETH has held above both moving averages since early May, and the current price action appears to be building up pressure for a decisive move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, ETH must now break above $2,700 convincingly to confirm a breakout and signal a continuation toward higher resistance at $2,850 and beyond. This level has been tested multiple times, but sellers continue to defend it. A breakout could trigger a rapid move to $3,000, while failure to hold current levels could drag ETH back toward its previous support.

Here&#8217;s where the target could lie, based on the pattern. Dogecoin Has Just Seen A Surge Beyond Bull Pennant Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has been forming in the hourly price of Dogecoin recently. The pattern in question is a &#8220;Bull Pennant,&#8221; which is a type of Pennant from technical analysis (TA). A Pennant forms whenever the price of an asset witnesses consolidation between two converging trendlines following a sharp move. The initial rapid move is known as the &#8216;pole,&#8217; and the consolidation channel as the &#8216;pennant.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet This arrangement is similar to that seen in Flag patterns, with the main difference between the two being the fact that Flags involve parallel consolidation channels, not triangular ones. Just like other consolidation patterns in TA, when the price is stuck inside the pennant portion, it is likely to face resistance at the upper level and support at the lower one. Pennants are usually considered continuation patterns, so a breakout is more probable to occur in the same direction as the preceding move (that is, the same orientation as the pole). When the pole is pointing in the up direction, the resulting Pennant is called a Bull Pennant. Similarly, it being in the opposite direction forms what&#8217;s known as a Bear Pennant. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Bull Pennant that the 1-hour Dogecoin price has potentially been trading inside recently: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin was witnessing net consolidation toward the downside inside this Bull Pennant earlier, but now, with the latest rally in the asset, its price has managed to find a break above the resistance line. So far, the memecoin hasn&#8217;t gained too much distance over the line, so it&#8217;s unconfirmed whether this is a real breakout. In the scenario that it is indeed the case and the governing pattern here is a Bull Pennant, then it&#8217;s possible that DOGE could end up seeing a rally of a similar scale as the pole of the pattern. The length of the pole involved in this Bull Pennant puts the breakout target at around $0.31. If the memecoin can manage a run to this mark, then its price would have gone up by almost 30% from the current level. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows It now remains to be seen how Dogecoin would develop in the coming days and whether its path would look anything like the one traced by the pattern.

I have a meme coin idea but no previous experience with Bitcoin. Is it hard to start? Can I pass my idea on to someone here or work with someone here? Would anyone be interested in working with me or potentially buying the concept off me?

With Bitcoin officially entering price discovery and surging past its all-time highs, attention is turning toward ETH, which is now testing critical resistance levels. Ethereum has gained over 55% since early May, riding the wave of broader market strength and renewed investor confidence. However, despite the impressive recovery, ETH still lags behind Bitcoin’s pace and has yet to reclaim its 2021 highs.

This range-bound price action signals indecision, as buyers remain active but haven’t yet triggered a breakout. Daan notes that although Bitcoin is showing strong leadership with its push into new highs, Ethereum’s performance in this phase has been more muted. Still, the setup remains constructive for bulls. The $2,400 level has acted as solid support, while resistance above $2,800 remains the next target to clear for continuation. As Bitcoin continues to lead, ETH could be next in line to surge—if it can escape this range and follow BTC’s lead into a new leg higher. All eyes are now on Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum Prepares For A Breakout As Altcoins Enter The Spotlight As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $111K, the broader crypto market appears to be entering a fresh phase of momentum, one that could drive massive gains across altcoins. Among them, Ethereum remains in a critical position. While ETH hasn’t followed BTC’s breakout just yet, it’s holding firmly above support and showing signs of building strength. To confirm a bullish continuation, ETH needs to break decisively above resistance and lead the altcoin rally. Daan shared a technical view highlighting that ETH has been consolidating between the $2,400 and $2,600 levels since its last squeeze higher. Despite Bitcoin’s explosive move, Ethereum is once again lagging, a dynamic that’s been reflected in a cooling ETH/BTC ratio. This underperformance has sparked debate among traders, with many waiting for ETH to catch up and drive the next altseason. Daan emphasized that the $2,500 zone has been well-defended by bulls, but ETH has yet to produce a convincing breakout. The key resistance level to watch is $2,850—clearing it would mark a technical shift toward higher highs. On the flip side, if ETH falls below $2,100, it could trigger a broader pullback. For now, ETH remains range-bound but poised, with market sentiment growing more optimistic by the day. Related Reading: Solana Multi-Year Uptrend Holds Strong – Analyst Sees SOL Breaking ATH This Year ETH Tests Critical Price Levels Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength on the 4-hour chart, trading around $2,668 at the time of writing. After weeks of consolidation in the $2,400–$2,600 range, ETH has pushed toward the upper boundary of this zone, hinting at a possible breakout. The recent bounce from support around $2,450 has been strong, with consecutive green candles and rising volume signaling increasing bullish momentum. The 200-period SMA and EMA, currently at $2,077 and $2,1,99 respectively, are well below the current price, confirming a bullish market structure. ETH has held above both moving averages since early May, and the current price action appears to be building up pressure for a decisive move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest However, ETH must now break above $2,700 convincingly to confirm a breakout and signal a continuation toward higher resistance at $2,850 and beyond. This level has been tested multiple times, but sellers continue to defend it. A breakout could trigger a rapid move to $3,000, while failure to hold current levels could drag ETH back toward its previous support.

2025-05-23T06:45:01.925409+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target?. An analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin is showing a break out of a Bull Pennant. Here&#8217;s where the target could lie, based on the pattern. Dogecoin Has Just Seen A Surge Beyond Bull Pennant Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has been forming in the hourly price of Dogecoin recently. The pattern in question is a &#8220;Bull Pennant,&#8221; which is a type of Pennant from technical analysis (TA). A Pennant forms whenever the price of an asset witnesses consolidation between two converging trendlines following a sharp move. The initial rapid move is known as the &#8216;pole,&#8217; and the consolidation channel as the &#8216;pennant.&#8217; Related Reading: Bitcoin Sets New ATH, But This Metric Says No Overheating Yet This arrangement is similar to that seen in Flag patterns, with the main difference between the two being the fact that Flags involve parallel consolidation channels, not triangular ones. Just like other consolidation patterns in TA, when the price is stuck inside the pennant portion, it is likely to face resistance at the upper level and support at the lower one. Pennants are usually considered continuation patterns, so a breakout is more probable to occur in the same direction as the preceding move (that is, the same orientation as the pole). When the pole is pointing in the up direction, the resulting Pennant is called a Bull Pennant. Similarly, it being in the opposite direction forms what&#8217;s known as a Bear Pennant. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Bull Pennant that the 1-hour Dogecoin price has potentially been trading inside recently: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin was witnessing net consolidation toward the downside inside this Bull Pennant earlier, but now, with the latest rally in the asset, its price has managed to find a break above the resistance line. So far, the memecoin hasn&#8217;t gained too much distance over the line, so it&#8217;s unconfirmed whether this is a real breakout. In the scenario that it is indeed the case and the governing pattern here is a Bull Pennant, then it&#8217;s possible that DOGE could end up seeing a rally of a similar scale as the pole of the pattern. The length of the pole involved in this Bull Pennant puts the breakout target at around $0.31. If the memecoin can manage a run to this mark, then its price would have gone up by almost 30% from the current level. Related Reading: $3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows It now remains to be seen how Dogecoin would develop in the coming days and whether its path would look anything like the one traced by the pattern.

I was at a dinner party when I casually mentioned that I held a decent amount of Ethereum, and the table—full of Bitcoin maxis—immediately burst into laughter. They started pointing out how Ethereum had become bloated, centralized, and a playground for pump-and-dump tokens. Then, one by one, they pulled out their cold wallets and flexed their BTC-only holdings like sacred relics.

They asked if I’d checked Ethereum’s gas fees lately, or how many L2s it takes to send $20, and someone even joked that ETH was the Yahoo of crypto. They then pulled up Ethereum’s price chart next to Bitcoin’s and erupted into another round of roaring laughter while making the “pinching fingers” (🤏) gesture to show how little ETH dominance remained.",-0.1401041666666666,

I am in the process of finding a new wallet, and although I love Exodus, it is closed-source and that's just not sustainable for my purposes. After researching extensively via AI and forum posts, Coin Wallet seems to tick all the right boxes:

\- open-source

\- passed all 8 tests on WalletScrutiny

\- handles alts like Ripple, Cardano, Solana

\- desktop, non-custodial, no KYC

I guess it may not have as many in-depth features such as NFT management, or staking, or ramps for buying / selling crypto, but in terms of simple HODLing it seems to be foolproof. Given the difficulty of finding a desktop wallet that handles so many alts, is there something I'm missing?",0.2565525383707202,

Bitcoin broke all previous records over the past 24 hours, hitting a new all-time high of $111K. This is particularly remarkable if we remember that $BTC was still languishing around $75K in early April. This marks a 50% increase in under two months. $BTC’s newfound momentum seems to have rubbed off on other top cryptos as well, including Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana: $ETH is already up 45% in May, currently trading at around $2,570. $SOL is trading at around $177 after a +20% bump this month. $DOGE isn’t far behind, with gains of over 30%; the coin is now trading at $0.2328. In this article, we’ll go over why Ethereum is at the helm of the current altcoin rally. We’ll also cover the best crypto to buy now to help you make the most of the new altcoin season. Ethereum Leading the Pack Bitcoin briefly brushed past the $109K mark after Trump was announced president. Soon after, though, the excitement died down, tariffs entered the chat, and the broader crypto market went into a sharp downtrend. By early April, Bitcoin plummeted to $75K. However, Christmas came early in May, with a sharp crypto reversal and no signs of stopping anytime soon. Ethereum, not Bitcoin, is at the forefront of this crypto rally, though. $ETH&#8217;s daily gains have beaten $BTC&#8217;s recently. The number of active daily users on Ethereum DEX has also jumped to 64,000, the highest in three months. What&#8217;s more, $ETH&#8217;s current DEX volumes of around $15B suggest increasing market participation in the coming months. The Ethereum Foundation has also launched the Trillion Dollar Security initiative, which aims to build a civilization-scale infrastructure. It plans to onboard billions of people, letting them store more than $1,000 on-chain. Institutions and governments could also store up to $1T on a single contract. Security is at the forefront here; the 1TS project will analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum’s security architecture and build an overview report. High-priority security issues will be addressed to make the security more transparent, further enhancing communication across the Ethereum blockchain. Increasing crypto prices and higher DEX participation are classic indicators of strong bull runs. We might still be sitting at the beginning of what could be a once-in-a-lifetime surge in the crypto market. If you don&#8217;t want to sit this one out, here are a few altcoins you can invest in right now to ride the wave. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for Real-Time Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) aims to make profitable crypto investing accessible to everyone. It plans to do so with its own AI agent, which is programmed to identify the best cryptos to invest in on your behalf. The $MIND AI agent is both autonomous and self-evolving, and it works by interacting with the crypto community on X. It first listens to all the unique biases and insights into crypto floating online. Then, it uses AI to join the dots between social trends, market sentiment, and on-chain activity to discover the next cryptos to explode. In addition to $MIND&#8217;s real-time, actionable crypto trading plays, you&#8217;ll also get early-bird access to the new crypto tokens it creates firsthand. It&#8217;s worth noting that time is running out. The presale has already surpassed $10M and will end in seven days. Now&#8217;s the moment to buy $MIND and grab the next big crypto coin for a low price of $0.0037515. Learn how to buy $MIND now to benefit from a potential 800% growth in its price in the next five years. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Crypto to Buy in 2025 BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) has completely redefined what a Bitcoin-themed meme coin is. Unlike other cryptos that are Bitcoin lovers in name only, $BTCBULL wants to follow the king cryptocurrency through hell and high water. This new crypto is perfect for Bitcoin maximalists who want to make the most of the &#8216;digital gold rush.&#8217; That&#8217;s because in addition to seeing your $BTCBULL investment swell up with rising Bitcoin prices, you&#8217;ll also benefit from free $BTC airdrops. Each time Bitcoin crosses a new milestone for the first time (such as $150K or $200K), $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive real $BTC rewards. Additionally, the developers have also planned to scrape off a part of the total BTC Bull Token supply with rising Bitcoin prices. So, every time Bitcoin sees a $50K gain in its price, a $BTCBULL token burn event will occur. Doing so will rapidly reduce the total number of available $BTCBULL tokens in a Bitcoin bull run, which would massively boost its demand and price as investors flock to purchase an altcoin that gives them free $BTC. Luckily for you, BTC Bull Token is currently in presale. It has raised over $6.2M at the time of writing, and you can buy each token for just $0.002525. Here&#8217;s how to buy $BTCBULL. 3. Trump Dinner ($DINNER) – Latest Trump-Centric Meme Coin Babe, wake up! Another Trump-based meme coin just launched! Trump Dinner ($DINNER) is the latest example of why betting on Donald Trump&#8217;s popularity among crypto degens could be a rather smart financial decision. This top trending crypto is based on a recent announcement on $TRUMP&#8217;s official website. It read that the top 220 $TRUMP token holders will be invited to an exclusive dinner gala with the president himself, and that, too, at his private Virginia golf club. What&#8217;s more, the top 25 $TRUMP holders will also be invited to an even more exclusive event. They&#8217;ll get a &#8216;special tour&#8217; and &#8216;private VIP reception with the President.&#8217; As the anticipation for this event builds, the crypto community has responded with $DINNER. This token is fresh off the oven; it launched just a couple of days ago but has already posted brain-melting gains. $DINNER is up over 15,000% since its launch, including a 1,000% gain in just the last 24 hours. This is $TRUMP all over again. The Best Crypto to Buy Now to Ride the Market’s Newfound Enthusiasm The rise of major cryptos like $ETH, $BTC, $SOL, and $DOGE is a telling sign that the coming weeks and months could be prosperous for crypto investors. To make the most of the upcoming rally, consider top altcoins like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Bear in mind that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. One wrong world event could send everything crashing down. We urge you to do your own research before investing. This article is not financial advice.",0.222959883831096,

2025-05-23T17:45:10.077556+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"Beyond digital gold, why Ethereum's PoS, multi-client design & ""buy-in UBI"" model are key to societal alignment

I want to pose a challenge to our collective thinking, especially as we ponder the future of crypto and its impact on the world. We often talk about ""digital gold"" and decentralization, but are we truly thinking about systemic solutions to the biggest challenges humanity faces?

I've been thinking a lot about Universal Basic Income (UBI) and its potential to fundamentally realign societal incentives. My argument is simple: if we want to solve climate change, mitigate AI risks, reduce war, combat inequality, and genuinely move towards a more peaceful, collaborative world, UBI is the most obvious, foundational solution. It grants economic freedom, allowing people to say ""no"" to destructive practices, collaborate rather than compete, and escape exploitative relationships.

And here's where Ethereum (and specifically its Proof-of-Stake model) enters the chat as something far more profound than just another ""altcoin.""

Let's be blunt about Bitcoin, its ""digital gold"" narrative is increasingly strained by its incentive structure. The halvings constantly reduce miner rewards, forcing reliance on transaction fees that haven't consistently materialized. Worse, Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining model has fundamentally centralized over time. What started with home CPU/GPU mining quickly shifted to ASIC farms and then warehouse-scale operations. Unless you have free energy, you simply cannot compete. Bitcoin has, in effect, replicated the centralization of power and wealth we see in traditional banks, exacerbating inequality rather than solving it.

Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) offers a stark, superior contrast:

1. True Decentralization of Participation: With PoS, you can stake any amount of ETH to participate in securing the network and earning rewards. You don't need a warehouse full of ASICs or access to industrial-scale cheap energy. This democratizes participation, enabling anyone with a stake to earn ""interest"" on their holdings without needing a bank. It's a financial system rebuilt from the ground up, returning power to individual holders.
2. ""Buy-in UBI"" for the Community: By staking, you actively contribute to the network's security and consensus, and in return, you earn a yield. This is a decentralized, programmatic way of distributing a ""basic income"" (in ETH) to those who genuinely hold a stake in the community. It's a system where ""you be I"" – your participation is the network, and the network rewards your active contribution.
3. Unparalleled Resiliency & Design Philosophy: Beyond PoS, Ethereum's architecture is unique. It boasts multiple independent developer teams, each building their own client in different programming languages. The protocol is even split into two distinct layers: Execution and Consensus. This multi-client, layered approach completely avoids the ""client-as-specification"" issue that has plagued Bitcoin, where effectively one client dictates the protocol. This design makes Ethereum incredibly robust, censorship-resistant, and resilient to single points of failure.
4. The Only Battle-Tested, Scalable Contender: No other blockchain has undergone the level of real-world testing, continuous upgrades (like The Merge), and community engagement that Ethereum has. While Bitcoin stopped scaling long ago, Ethereum is aggressively pursuing a modular, rollup-centric roadmap designed for global adoption and immense transaction volume. This makes it the only viable decentralized medium of trust, the essential bookkeeping layer needed to keep a post-money society (think Star Trek!) accountable.

Why this matters for society:

We need to move towards a post-money society eventually, but on the way, we'll need UBI to prevent collapse during the transition. UBI adoption needs to be gradual. For this, we need a decentralized, secure, and scalable medium of trust, something Ethereum, with its robust design, PoS, and active ecosystem, is uniquely positioned to provide. It represents the decentralized future that Bitcoin's design ultimately failed to achieve.

My frustration often stems from seeing humanity continually miss the obvious, getting bogged down in tribalism and short-sighted debates while truly transformative solutions are right in front of us. If only more people understood Ethereum's true potential beyond just a tradeable asset, I wouldn't have to write this rant post for on Reddit.

So, my question to you all is: Are we focusing too much on the ""digital gold"" narrative and individual coin prices, and not enough on how robust, genuinely decentralized technologies like Ethereum can fundamentally reshape our economic and social contracts for a more peaceful and equitable future?

Let's discuss. I'm ready for the friction.",0.1128605303910181,

2025-05-23T17:45:10.077556+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Leads Altcoin Rally with Solana and Dogecoin – Best Crypto to Buy Now. Bitcoin broke all previous records over the past 24 hours, hitting a new all-time high of $111K. This is particularly remarkable if we remember that $BTC was still languishing around $75K in early April. This marks a 50% increase in under two months. $BTC’s newfound momentum seems to have rubbed off on other top cryptos as well, including Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana: $ETH is already up 45% in May, currently trading at around $2,570. $SOL is trading at around $177 after a +20% bump this month. $DOGE isn’t far behind, with gains of over 30%; the coin is now trading at $0.2328. In this article, we’ll go over why Ethereum is at the helm of the current altcoin rally. We’ll also cover the best crypto to buy now to help you make the most of the new altcoin season. Ethereum Leading the Pack Bitcoin briefly brushed past the $109K mark after Trump was announced president. Soon after, though, the excitement died down, tariffs entered the chat, and the broader crypto market went into a sharp downtrend. By early April, Bitcoin plummeted to $75K. However, Christmas came early in May, with a sharp crypto reversal and no signs of stopping anytime soon. Ethereum, not Bitcoin, is at the forefront of this crypto rally, though. $ETH&#8217;s daily gains have beaten $BTC&#8217;s recently. The number of active daily users on Ethereum DEX has also jumped to 64,000, the highest in three months. What&#8217;s more, $ETH&#8217;s current DEX volumes of around $15B suggest increasing market participation in the coming months. The Ethereum Foundation has also launched the Trillion Dollar Security initiative, which aims to build a civilization-scale infrastructure. It plans to onboard billions of people, letting them store more than $1,000 on-chain. Institutions and governments could also store up to $1T on a single contract. Security is at the forefront here; the 1TS project will analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum’s security architecture and build an overview report. High-priority security issues will be addressed to make the security more transparent, further enhancing communication across the Ethereum blockchain. Increasing crypto prices and higher DEX participation are classic indicators of strong bull runs. We might still be sitting at the beginning of what could be a once-in-a-lifetime surge in the crypto market. If you don&#8217;t want to sit this one out, here are a few altcoins you can invest in right now to ride the wave. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for Real-Time Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) aims to make profitable crypto investing accessible to everyone. It plans to do so with its own AI agent, which is programmed to identify the best cryptos to invest in on your behalf. The $MIND AI agent is both autonomous and self-evolving, and it works by interacting with the crypto community on X. It first listens to all the unique biases and insights into crypto floating online. Then, it uses AI to join the dots between social trends, market sentiment, and on-chain activity to discover the next cryptos to explode. In addition to $MIND&#8217;s real-time, actionable crypto trading plays, you&#8217;ll also get early-bird access to the new crypto tokens it creates firsthand. It&#8217;s worth noting that time is running out. The presale has already surpassed $10M and will end in seven days. Now&#8217;s the moment to buy $MIND and grab the next big crypto coin for a low price of $0.0037515. Learn how to buy $MIND now to benefit from a potential 800% growth in its price in the next five years. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Inspired Crypto to Buy in 2025 BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) has completely redefined what a Bitcoin-themed meme coin is. Unlike other cryptos that are Bitcoin lovers in name only, $BTCBULL wants to follow the king cryptocurrency through hell and high water. This new crypto is perfect for Bitcoin maximalists who want to make the most of the &#8216;digital gold rush.&#8217; That&#8217;s because in addition to seeing your $BTCBULL investment swell up with rising Bitcoin prices, you&#8217;ll also benefit from free $BTC airdrops. Each time Bitcoin crosses a new milestone for the first time (such as $150K or $200K), $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive real $BTC rewards. Additionally, the developers have also planned to scrape off a part of the total BTC Bull Token supply with rising Bitcoin prices. So, every time Bitcoin sees a $50K gain in its price, a $BTCBULL token burn event will occur. Doing so will rapidly reduce the total number of available $BTCBULL tokens in a Bitcoin bull run, which would massively boost its demand and price as investors flock to purchase an altcoin that gives them free $BTC. Luckily for you, BTC Bull Token is currently in presale. It has raised over $6.2M at the time of writing, and you can buy each token for just $0.002525. Here&#8217;s how to buy $BTCBULL. 3. Trump Dinner ($DINNER) – Latest Trump-Centric Meme Coin Babe, wake up! Another Trump-based meme coin just launched! Trump Dinner ($DINNER) is the latest example of why betting on Donald Trump&#8217;s popularity among crypto degens could be a rather smart financial decision. This top trending crypto is based on a recent announcement on $TRUMP&#8217;s official website. It read that the top 220 $TRUMP token holders will be invited to an exclusive dinner gala with the president himself, and that, too, at his private Virginia golf club. What&#8217;s more, the top 25 $TRUMP holders will also be invited to an even more exclusive event. They&#8217;ll get a &#8216;special tour&#8217; and &#8216;private VIP reception with the President.&#8217; As the anticipation for this event builds, the crypto community has responded with $DINNER. This token is fresh off the oven; it launched just a couple of days ago but has already posted brain-melting gains. $DINNER is up over 15,000% since its launch, including a 1,000% gain in just the last 24 hours. This is $TRUMP all over again. The Best Crypto to Buy Now to Ride the Market’s Newfound Enthusiasm The rise of major cryptos like $ETH, $BTC, $SOL, and $DOGE is a telling sign that the coming weeks and months could be prosperous for crypto investors. To make the most of the upcoming rally, consider top altcoins like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Bear in mind that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. One wrong world event could send everything crashing down. We urge you to do your own research before investing. This article is not financial advice.",0.222959883831096,

Dogecoin started a fresh increase and climbed above the $0.2420 zone against the US Dollar. DOGE is now correcting gains and might start another increase. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.2320 and $0.2420 levels. The price is trading above the $0.2420 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2460 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.2550 resistance zone. Dogecoin Price Extends Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it found support near $0.2220, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE climbed and recovered above the $0.2350 resistance zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.2420 resistance zone. However, the bears were active near the $0.2550 level. A high was formed at $0.2542 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2227 swing low to the $0.2542 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2450 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2460 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2550 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2620 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2650 level. A close above the $0.2680 resistance might send the price toward the $0.280 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2840 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.30. Downside Correction In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2550 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2450 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.2385 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2227 swing low to the $0.2542 high. The main support sits at $0.2320. If there is a downside break below the $0.2320 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.220 level or even $0.2120 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

Bitcoin broke all previous records over the past 24 hours, hitting a new all-time high of $111K. This is particularly remarkable if we remember that $BTC was still languishing around $75K in early April. This marks a 50% increase in under two months. $BTC’s newfound momentum seems to have rubbed off on other top cryptos as well, including Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana: $ETH is already up 45% in May, currently trading at around $2,570. $SOL is trading at around $177 after a +20% bump this month. $DOGE isn’t far behind, with gains of over 30%; the coin is now trading at $0.2328. In this article, we’ll go over why Ethereum is at the helm of the current altcoin rally. We’ll also cover the best crypto to buy now to help you make the most of the new altcoin season. Ethereum Leading the Pack Bitcoin briefly brushed past the $109K mark after Trump was announced president. Soon after, though, the excitement died down, tariffs entered the chat, and the broader crypto market went into a sharp downtrend. By early April, Bitcoin plummeted to $75K. However, Christmas came early in May, with a sharp crypto reversal and no signs of stopping anytime soon. Ethereum, not Bitcoin, is at the forefront of this crypto rally, though. $ETH&#8217;s daily gains have beaten $BTC&#8217;s recently. The number of active daily users on Ethereum DEX has also jumped to 64,000, the highest in three months. What&#8217;s more, $ETH&#8217;s current DEX volumes of around $15B suggest increasing market participation in the coming months. The Ethereum Foundation has also launched the Trillion Dollar Security initiative, which aims to build a civilization-scale infrastructure. It plans to onboard billions of people, letting them store more than $1,000 on-chain. Institutions and governments could also store up to $1T on a single contract. Security is at the forefront here; the 1TS project will analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum’s security architecture and build an overview report. High-priority security issues will be addressed to make the security more transparent, further enhancing communication across the Ethereum blockchain.

Solana (SOL) is beginning to show signs of renewed strength as technical indicators hint at a potential breakout. On the weekly chart, the MACD is curling up and has recently crossed above the signal line, a bullish signal that often precedes major price movements. With momentum slowly building, traders are now watching closely to see if this shift marks the beginning of a larger rally. Momentum Builds For A Possible Solana Breakout In a recent X post, market analyst Willjayducks drew attention to a significant bearish divergence that unfolded on the Solana weekly chart. He pointed out that as the price surged into its blow-off top, the RSI and MACD indicators showed weakening momentum. This divergence between price action and momentum indicators is a classic technical pattern that typically precedes sharp corrections.

According to Willjayducks, this dramatic drop suggests the bearish divergence has “arguably played out,” implying that the correction phase may be nearing its end.  He further elaborated that the MACD is now curling upward and has recently crossed above the signal line. This crossover suggests that the recent downward pressure may be easing, setting the stage for a potential recovery. According to his analysis, if SOL can gather enough strength and sustain its current upward momentum, the MACD line could eventually cross above the zero line, a more definitive bullish signal that typically confirms a shift in trend. Should this scenario unfold, the analyst believes Solana may be poised to push toward new highs, reigniting interest among traders and investors. However, he also noted a word of caution: if or when this bullish breakout occurs, he’ll be closely monitoring the chart for any emerging signs of bearish divergence, which could once again hint at an overheated market. Bearish Outcome Still On The Table In the climax, the analyst mentioned that there is still a chance things just fizzle out here and continue into a bear trend. Despite recent bullish signals and technical improvements, he cautioned that the current momentum might not be strong enough to sustain a full reversal.  Related Reading: Solana Short-Term Indicator Signals Potential Risk – Reversal Or Pause? While price action may stall, leading the market back into a prolonged period of downside movement, Willjayducks emphasized that all we can do for now is watch price action closely and plan for all scenarios.

2025-05-23T19:03:05.294541+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Analyst Says This Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Contender Could See ‘Impulsive Move’. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain the top leaders when it comes to meme coins, but others have been creeping up as fierce contenders over time. Back in 2021, when the original meme coin bull run started, the likes of FLOKI had crept up from the shadows to also become investor favorites. Through the bear market and into the current bull market, FLOKI has shown incredible strength, and one crypto trader believes that there is still a lot of runway for the meme coin. Why FLOKI Is A Great Choice Over Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Crypto trader and analyst Unipcs, also popularly known as ‘Bonk Guy,’ has given reasons why buying FLOKI could be a better play compared to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. In addition to the fact that it was created back in 2021 and has survived a bear market alongside Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, FLOKI has other characteristics that has made it a great meme coin choice. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens One of the major driving forces behind the support for FLOKI comes with the expectation of an Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) to be launched for the meme coin. This puts it miles ahead of other meme coins which are yet to see major institutional support. Furthermore, the FLOKI meme coin has already proven its position as a solid choice over Dogecoin or Shiba Inu after rallying to a new all-time high back in 2024. This saw it outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu as these market leaders continued to trend below their all-time high peaks from 2021. Just like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, FLOKI has also scored listings on major crypto exchanges across the space, in addition to smaller listings. It is trading on Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit, among others, with daily trading volumes crossing $200 million at the time of this writing. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Struggles As New Accounts Crash To Fresh Lows Moving on to the chart, the crypto trader also revealed that the FLOKI chart does look strong. After holding and sustaining accumulation through the start of 2025, the meme coin is riding up once again and has already broken through $0.0001. Given this, Unipcs believes that an impulsive move for FLOKI is only a matter of time from here. “The fact that FLOKI is still under the radar, despite cult-like loyalty from its holders and insane retail recognition, means any rally it gets will likely go much higher than anticipated—a classic hated rally setup,” the crypto analyst said in conclusion.

2025-05-24T00:45:01.962425+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"$1k invested into the Top Ten Cryptos in January 2021 - Month 52 (UP 291%)

[EXPERIMENT - Tracking 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies – Month Fifty-Two - UP 291&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/swdi3ak01j2f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=921c3916536ed982340a5636050b42f6ce2094fb)

***Full blog post with all the tables*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-52)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAY snapshot).**

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I created a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment annually 2019-2025 because I'm a glutton for punishment (and to show different entry points).
* ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)
* **APRIL HIGHLIGHTS:** **BCH** and **BTC** turned in the strongest performances this month. **BNB** continues to maintain a strong overall lead, followed very distantly by **XRP**, then **ADA**, then **BTC**. 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +291% in fifty-two months vs. the S&P500's +49%.
* **2018-2025 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +233% compared to +54% in the S&P 500 if invested as per the rules of the Experiments.**

# Month Fifty-Two – UP 291%

https://preview.redd.it/2gwoauqj1j2f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f754e95cc29bf608362d38357d6c9ceea99901fc

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

April highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* **BCH** and **BTC** turned in the strongest performances this month
* **BNB** is still miles ahead overall, followed very distantly by **XRP**.
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +291% in fifty-two months

# April Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/wxb7palm1j2f1.png?width=306&format=png&auto=webp&s=81a32553bd0b934dfbd8de9f1e8db5dca9eda1cf

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  fifty-two months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, only four cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Litecoin, Polkadot** and **Bitcoin Cash.**

# April Winners and Losers

***April Winners*** – **BCH** (+18%) followed by **BTC** (+14%).

***April Losers*** – **ETH** turned in the worst performance, down -2% this month.

# Overall Update – BNB dominates, XRP in distant second place, 80% of cryptos in green, DOT worst performing

As has been the case for most of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, **BNB** remains the dominant crypto in the portfolio, by far.  It is up **+1,458%**, the $100 investment into **BNB** fifty-two months ago now worth **$1563.**  

**XRP** is in distant second place, up +821% followed by **ADA** (+295%) in third place.

At the bottom, **DOT** is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down **-52%** since January 2021. 

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/epttbfjo1j2f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3cbf560ada6acfbc8174d4f3314e9fcb46ff71

**BitDom** has been up only lately, now sitting at 63.8% and has been on an uptrend since early 2023. 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

https://preview.redd.it/j0k55pxq1j2f1.png?width=222&format=png&auto=webp&s=481469156f973b36740c22079511a0a93590ab00

Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +291%.  The initial $1000 investment fifty-two months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth **$3,915**. 

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

As most readers are aware, this is the eighth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, at the height of a crypto bull run.  Where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +36% (total value $1,355)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +585% (total value $6,849)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +785% (total value $8,848) (***best performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +291% (total value $3,915)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -19% (total value $810) (***worst performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +157% (total value $2,569)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +47% (total value $1,471)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $822)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,638.**

https://preview.redd.it/yz6heaky1j2f1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d41f8911a55f74949c72103f8d2f199433088bf

**That’s up +233%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was **November 2021’s all time high** of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/nifx6dc02j2f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=879edb67a565b783637af8a160e2792984eb4787

In summary: ***That’s a +233% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/taqjnhl32j2f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=847da29551ee95cac60d44cedc514e1fff8b5a84

The S&P 500 Index is up **+49%** since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto fifty-two months ago would be worth **$1,492** had it been redirected to the S&P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+291%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto fifty-two months ago is now worth **$3,915.**

That’s a difference of **$2,423** on a $1k investment in fifty-two months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first eight years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,097 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,236 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,735 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,176 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,460 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,175 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $953 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,323.**

That is up **+54%** since January 2018 compared to a **+233%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined eight year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&P up to this point:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.  

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.  A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  April’s extended report is on the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio (the one you’re reading now).  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2025 Top Ten reports as well.",0.143558852413019,

2025-05-24T00:45:01.962425+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Leads Altcoin Rally with Solana and Dogecoin – Best Crypto to Buy Now. Bitcoin broke all previous records over the past 24 hours, hitting a new all-time high of $111K. This is particularly remarkable if we remember that $BTC was still languishing around $75K in early April. This marks a 50% increase in under two months. $BTC’s newfound momentum seems to have rubbed off on other top cryptos as well, including Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana: $ETH is already up 45% in May, currently trading at around $2,570. $SOL is trading at around $177 after a +20% bump this month. $DOGE isn’t far behind, with gains of over 30%; the coin is now trading at $0.2328. In this article, we’ll go over why Ethereum is at the helm of the current altcoin rally. We’ll also cover the best crypto to buy now to help you make the most of the new altcoin season. Ethereum Leading the Pack Bitcoin briefly brushed past the $109K mark after Trump was announced president. Soon after, though, the excitement died down, tariffs entered the chat, and the broader crypto market went into a sharp downtrend. By early April, Bitcoin plummeted to $75K. However, Christmas came early in May, with a sharp crypto reversal and no signs of stopping anytime soon. Ethereum, not Bitcoin, is at the forefront of this crypto rally, though. $ETH&#8217;s daily gains have beaten $BTC&#8217;s recently. The number of active daily users on Ethereum DEX has also jumped to 64,000, the highest in three months. What&#8217;s more, $ETH&#8217;s current DEX volumes of around $15B suggest increasing market participation in the coming months. The Ethereum Foundation has also launched the Trillion Dollar Security initiative, which aims to build a civilization-scale infrastructure. It plans to onboard billions of people, letting them store more than $1,000 on-chain. Institutions and governments could also store up to $1T on a single contract. Security is at the forefront here; the 1TS project will analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum’s security architecture and build an overview report. High-priority security issues will be addressed to make the security more transparent, further enhancing communication across the Ethereum blockchain. Increasing crypto prices and higher DEX participation are classic indicators of strong bull runs. We might still be sitting at the beginning of what could be a once-in-a-lifetime surge in the crypto market. If you don&#8217;t want to sit this one out, here are a few altcoins you can invest in right now to ride the wave. 1.

2025-05-24T01:45:01.377026+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"Can a Currency Work Without Fees? Nano Says, ""Yes it can!""

  
I know r/CryptoCurrency has plenty of Bitcoin fans (rightly so). Still, I think this feeless model is worth a quick look—constructive comments welcome.  
  
**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

2025-05-24T02:45:01.997707+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"Can a Currency Work Without Fees? Nano Says, ""Yes it can!""

  
I know r/CryptoCurrency has plenty of Bitcoin fans (rightly so). Still, I think this feeless model is worth a quick look—constructive comments welcome.  
  
**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

2025-05-24T03:45:01.266557+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"Can a Currency Work Without Fees? Nano Says, ""Yes it can!""

  
I know r/CryptoCurrency has plenty of Bitcoin fans (rightly so). Still, I think this feeless model is worth a quick look—constructive comments welcome.  
  
**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

A successful break and consolidation above this area could unlock the next leg up for Ethereum, potentially bringing higher prices back into focus for traders and investors. The broader sentiment remains optimistic, with bulls increasingly confident that ETH could lead a renewed altcoin rally if momentum sustains. However, analysts also caution that the $2,700 region must be cleared with strong volume and follow-through to confirm a breakout. Until then, Ethereum&#8217;s price action remains in a delicate position, teetering on the edge of a major rally or another round of consolidation. Ethereum Facing A Crucial Test Ethereum is positioning itself for a potential bullish recovery as it continues to consolidate above key levels after a multi-week rally. Since early May, ETH has gained over 55% in value, signaling renewed strength in the altcoin market. The recent breakout of Bitcoin to new all-time highs above $111K has triggered optimism across the board, setting the stage for a possible altseason. For that to happen, Ethereum must lead the charge with a clean breakout into higher territory. Currently, ETH is trading just below the $2,700 level, a key resistance zone that has historically acted as a major turning point for price action. According to Cheds, reclaiming $2,700 is crucial. A firm move above this threshold would likely confirm a bullish continuation, opening the door toward the $2,900–$3,000 range. So far, Ethereum has shown resilience, defending the $2,500–$2,600 zone effectively during the recent market consolidation. If bulls maintain control and volume increases, the breakout could materialize sooner rather than later. However, failure to push past $2,700 could trigger a new wave of hesitation, keeping ETH range-bound in the short term. As Bitcoin continues its upward trend, all eyes are now on Ethereum to see whether it can match that strength and lead the broader market higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows – Volatility Returns ETH Price Action Details Ethereum is showing solid bullish structure on the 4-hour chart, consolidating just under the key $2,700 resistance level after a strong rally from early May lows. Price action is currently holding above the short-term exponential moving average (EMA 34) at $2,574, which acts as dynamic support. Meanwhile, the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) at $2,543, $2,443, and $2,109, respectively, continue to align in a bullish formation, signaling a healthy trend. Despite some volatility, ETH has consistently defended the $2,650–$2,670 region during recent dips, suggesting strong buyer interest just below resistance. Volume has remained steady, though not aggressive, which implies that bulls are cautiously optimistic while waiting for confirmation of a breakout above the $2,700 level. A decisive candle close above $2,700 could trigger the next leg up, potentially targeting the $2,850–$3,000 range. However, failure to push higher may lead to another test of support at $2,570 or even the $2,540 zone.

Dogecoin&#8217;s recent price action has taken a noticeably bullish turn, with the meme coin bouncing off support at the beginning of the week and steadily building upward momentum. Over the past few days, Dogecoin has been on the path to reclaiming the $0.25 level after rebounding from a low near $0.215. This upward move coincides with Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs, which has helped to inject new confidence across the broader crypto market.  Notably, technical analysis of the Dogecoin/TetherUS pair on the daily candlestick timeframe shows that the meme coin&#8217;s price has now flipped into an ascending channel headed for at least $0.3. Dogecoin Confirms Bullish Breakout As Trendline Crumbles According to a technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst Melika, Dogecoin has bounced on through a long-standing bearish trendline that had acted as a major resistance in April. This breakout is a by a clear validation of an ascending channel that has formed since late April.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Falling Wedge Breakout Puts Bulls In Charge, Target Moves Up To $0.62 The breakout indicates a full transition from bearish pressure into a bullish environment, with the price structure now leaning heavily in favor of the bulls. In this case, Dogecoin is now on the path to continue its uptrend from its $0.13 bottom on April 7, and the next target is to reach the top of the ascending channel. A critical aspect of this breakout is the reaction from the midline of the channel, which Dogecoin respected with precision before climbing again. The coin also retested the demand block between $0.1950 and $0.2150 earlier in the week. The failure to break below shows that this region has now turned into a strong structural support moving forward. As long as the price remains above this level, Dogecoin&#8217;s potential of reaching the top of the ascending channel is valid. What Targets Lie Ahead For Dogecoin? With momentum now on the side of the bulls, Melika’s analysis projects three critical levels that could serve as short profit zones for Dogecoin traders. The first target is $0.2530, which aligns with the swing high on May 11. If Dogecoin bulls maintain the price uptrend, the second target of $0.2750 could come into play. Interestingly, this target is located at the upper boundary of the ascending channel. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally – Why $1 Is Still In The Cards Beyond that lies the major horizontal resistance at $0.3035. This level is significant because it acted as a support level for Dogecoin in January. However, Dogecoin eventually went on a clean breakthrough below $0.3035 in early February, which has flipped into a zone to look out for resistance. Breaking through this area would not only signal a full recovery from the recent downtrend but also open the door to higher price levels.  However, any rejection or breakdown below $0.1950 would invalidate this bullish thesis, as it would indicate a breach of both the demand zone and the channel structure. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2447, up by 2% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.0665672348484848,

I know r/CryptoCurrency has plenty of Bitcoin fans (rightly so). Still, I think this feeless model is worth a quick look—constructive comments welcome.  
  
**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

2025-05-24T04:45:01.898098+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger. Ethereum is at a critical juncture as it approaches the $2,700 level, widely viewed as the next key resistance that bulls must overcome to confirm a bullish setup. This comes as Bitcoin broke above its all-time high yesterday, pushing the crypto market into a new phase that could unleash substantial gains across altcoins. For Ethereum, this moment could define the next leg of its recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch Since early May, ETH has surged over 55%, fueled by renewed investor confidence, broader market strength, and increasing capital rotation from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins. The sentiment is shifting, and Ethereum’s ability to lead the charge will likely influence the pace of altseason. Glassnode data highlights the improving fundamentals behind the move. In May, Ethereum reclaimed its Realized Price at $1,900—putting the average holder back in profit after a long stretch in the red. Price has also climbed above the True Market Mean at $2,400, historically seen as a reliable bullish signal. However, a clear break above $2,700 remains essential to validate this trend and attract further momentum-driven capital. Whether ETH can deliver that confirmation will shape how quickly the altcoin market gains traction in the wake of Bitcoin’s breakout. Ethereum Holds Strong As Altcoin Momentum Builds Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge as investors position themselves for what many expect to be a massive rally in the coming weeks. After months of volatility, ETH has reasserted its strength by reclaiming key technical and on-chain levels. Since crossing back above the $2,200 mark, Ethereum’s price structure has leaned decisively bullish, forming higher lows and consolidating around a critical resistance zone near $2,700. Bulls remain firmly in control, and Ethereum is once again being looked to as the benchmark for broader altcoin sentiment. In a market environment now defined by Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above all-time highs, ETH is well-positioned to benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. To fully validate a bullish continuation, however, Ethereum must break above and hold the $2,700–$2,900 range. Glassnode on-chain data adds another layer of bullish conviction. In May, Ethereum broke above its Realized Price at $1,900, putting the average holder back in profit—a milestone that typically signals renewed investor confidence. ETH has also moved above its True Market Mean at $2,400, a key historical metric that aligns with strong accumulation phases. However, the final hurdle lies at the Active Realized Price, currently near $2,900. Reclaiming that level would not only confirm a major structural breakout but also signal that recent buyers are holding strong and that confidence has returned at scale. Until then, ETH remains in a powerful setup, but the next few sessions will be critical for confirming whether the altcoin market’s leader is ready to drive the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows – Volatility Returns ETH Price Tests Major Resistance Ethereum continues to push higher, with price currently consolidating around the $2,665 mark after briefly touching $2,734. The daily chart shows ETH holding a clear uptrend since early May, with higher lows and strong buying volume supporting the move. All key moving averages are sloping upward, with the 34 EMA currently at $2,249 and the 50 SMA at $1,965—both well below the current price, reinforcing bullish structure. The most immediate technical challenge lies at the 200-day SMA, marked at $2,703. This long-term indicator has acted as dynamic resistance in previous cycles and will be critical to watch. A daily close above this level could trigger a breakout and confirm a broader bullish continuation, possibly opening the door toward reclaiming the $2,900–$3,000 region. Related Reading: Litecoin Eyes $117.50 As Price Rebounds From Key Support – Analyst Volume has picked up slightly on recent green candles, signaling growing demand, but the test of the $2,700 zone could invite short-term profit taking.

Dogecoin Confirms Bullish Breakout As Trendline Crumbles According to a technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst Melika, Dogecoin has bounced on through a long-standing bearish trendline that had acted as a major resistance in April.

In this case, Dogecoin is now on the path to continue its uptrend from its $0.13 bottom on April 7, and the next target is to reach the top of the ascending channel. A critical aspect of this breakout is the reaction from the midline of the channel, which Dogecoin respected with precision before climbing again. The coin also retested the demand block between $0.1950 and $0.2150 earlier in the week. The failure to break below shows that this region has now turned into a strong structural support moving forward. As long as the price remains above this level, Dogecoin&#8217;s potential of reaching the top of the ascending channel is valid. What Targets Lie Ahead For Dogecoin? With momentum now on the side of the bulls, Melika’s analysis projects three critical levels that could serve as short profit zones for Dogecoin traders. The first target is $0.2530, which aligns with the swing high on May 11. If Dogecoin bulls maintain the price uptrend, the second target of $0.2750 could come into play.

I know r/CryptoCurrency has plenty of Bitcoin fans (rightly so). Still, I think this feeless model is worth a quick look—constructive comments welcome.  
  
**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

2025-05-24T05:45:01.917485+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger. Ethereum is at a critical juncture as it approaches the $2,700 level, widely viewed as the next key resistance that bulls must overcome to confirm a bullish setup. This comes as Bitcoin broke above its all-time high yesterday, pushing the crypto market into a new phase that could unleash substantial gains across altcoins. For Ethereum, this moment could define the next leg of its recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch Since early May, ETH has surged over 55%, fueled by renewed investor confidence, broader market strength, and increasing capital rotation from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins. The sentiment is shifting, and Ethereum’s ability to lead the charge will likely influence the pace of altseason. Glassnode data highlights the improving fundamentals behind the move. In May, Ethereum reclaimed its Realized Price at $1,900—putting the average holder back in profit after a long stretch in the red. Price has also climbed above the True Market Mean at $2,400, historically seen as a reliable bullish signal. However, a clear break above $2,700 remains essential to validate this trend and attract further momentum-driven capital. Whether ETH can deliver that confirmation will shape how quickly the altcoin market gains traction in the wake of Bitcoin’s breakout. Ethereum Holds Strong As Altcoin Momentum Builds Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge as investors position themselves for what many expect to be a massive rally in the coming weeks. After months of volatility, ETH has reasserted its strength by reclaiming key technical and on-chain levels. Since crossing back above the $2,200 mark, Ethereum’s price structure has leaned decisively bullish, forming higher lows and consolidating around a critical resistance zone near $2,700. Bulls remain firmly in control, and Ethereum is once again being looked to as the benchmark for broader altcoin sentiment. In a market environment now defined by Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above all-time highs, ETH is well-positioned to benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. To fully validate a bullish continuation, however, Ethereum must break above and hold the $2,700–$2,900 range. Glassnode on-chain data adds another layer of bullish conviction. In May, Ethereum broke above its Realized Price at $1,900, putting the average holder back in profit—a milestone that typically signals renewed investor confidence. ETH has also moved above its True Market Mean at $2,400, a key historical metric that aligns with strong accumulation phases. However, the final hurdle lies at the Active Realized Price, currently near $2,900. Reclaiming that level would not only confirm a major structural breakout but also signal that recent buyers are holding strong and that confidence has returned at scale. Until then, ETH remains in a powerful setup, but the next few sessions will be critical for confirming whether the altcoin market’s leader is ready to drive the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows – Volatility Returns ETH Price Tests Major Resistance Ethereum continues to push higher, with price currently consolidating around the $2,665 mark after briefly touching $2,734. The daily chart shows ETH holding a clear uptrend since early May, with higher lows and strong buying volume supporting the move. All key moving averages are sloping upward, with the 34 EMA currently at $2,249 and the 50 SMA at $1,965—both well below the current price, reinforcing bullish structure. The most immediate technical challenge lies at the 200-day SMA, marked at $2,703. This long-term indicator has acted as dynamic resistance in previous cycles and will be critical to watch. A daily close above this level could trigger a breakout and confirm a broader bullish continuation, possibly opening the door toward reclaiming the $2,900–$3,000 region.

2025-05-24T06:45:01.229521+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger. Ethereum is at a critical juncture as it approaches the $2,700 level, widely viewed as the next key resistance that bulls must overcome to confirm a bullish setup. This comes as Bitcoin broke above its all-time high yesterday, pushing the crypto market into a new phase that could unleash substantial gains across altcoins. For Ethereum, this moment could define the next leg of its recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch Since early May, ETH has surged over 55%, fueled by renewed investor confidence, broader market strength, and increasing capital rotation from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins. The sentiment is shifting, and Ethereum’s ability to lead the charge will likely influence the pace of altseason. Glassnode data highlights the improving fundamentals behind the move. In May, Ethereum reclaimed its Realized Price at $1,900—putting the average holder back in profit after a long stretch in the red. Price has also climbed above the True Market Mean at $2,400, historically seen as a reliable bullish signal. However, a clear break above $2,700 remains essential to validate this trend and attract further momentum-driven capital. Whether ETH can deliver that confirmation will shape how quickly the altcoin market gains traction in the wake of Bitcoin’s breakout. Ethereum Holds Strong As Altcoin Momentum Builds Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge as investors position themselves for what many expect to be a massive rally in the coming weeks. After months of volatility, ETH has reasserted its strength by reclaiming key technical and on-chain levels. Since crossing back above the $2,200 mark, Ethereum’s price structure has leaned decisively bullish, forming higher lows and consolidating around a critical resistance zone near $2,700. Bulls remain firmly in control, and Ethereum is once again being looked to as the benchmark for broader altcoin sentiment. In a market environment now defined by Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above all-time highs, ETH is well-positioned to benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. To fully validate a bullish continuation, however, Ethereum must break above and hold the $2,700–$2,900 range. Glassnode on-chain data adds another layer of bullish conviction. In May, Ethereum broke above its Realized Price at $1,900, putting the average holder back in profit—a milestone that typically signals renewed investor confidence. ETH has also moved above its True Market Mean at $2,400, a key historical metric that aligns with strong accumulation phases. However, the final hurdle lies at the Active Realized Price, currently near $2,900. Reclaiming that level would not only confirm a major structural breakout but also signal that recent buyers are holding strong and that confidence has returned at scale. Until then, ETH remains in a powerful setup, but the next few sessions will be critical for confirming whether the altcoin market’s leader is ready to drive the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows – Volatility Returns ETH Price Tests Major Resistance Ethereum continues to push higher, with price currently consolidating around the $2,665 mark after briefly touching $2,734. The daily chart shows ETH holding a clear uptrend since early May, with higher lows and strong buying volume supporting the move. All key moving averages are sloping upward, with the 34 EMA currently at $2,249 and the 50 SMA at $1,965—both well below the current price, reinforcing bullish structure. The most immediate technical challenge lies at the 200-day SMA, marked at $2,703. This long-term indicator has acted as dynamic resistance in previous cycles and will be critical to watch. A daily close above this level could trigger a breakout and confirm a broader bullish continuation, possibly opening the door toward reclaiming the $2,900–$3,000 region.

Dogecoin&#8217;s recent price action has taken a noticeably bullish turn, with the meme coin bouncing off support at the beginning of the week and steadily building upward momentum. Over the past few days, Dogecoin has been on the path to reclaiming the $0.25 level after rebounding from a low near $0.215. This upward move coincides with Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs, which has helped to inject new confidence across the broader crypto market.  Notably, technical analysis of the Dogecoin/TetherUS pair on the daily candlestick timeframe shows that the meme coin&#8217;s price has now flipped into an ascending channel headed for at least $0.3. Dogecoin Confirms Bullish Breakout As Trendline Crumbles According to a technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst Melika, Dogecoin has bounced on through a long-standing bearish trendline that had acted as a major resistance in April. This breakout is a by a clear validation of an ascending channel that has formed since late April.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Falling Wedge Breakout Puts Bulls In Charge, Target Moves Up To $0.62 The breakout indicates a full transition from bearish pressure into a bullish environment, with the price structure now leaning heavily in favor of the bulls. In this case, Dogecoin is now on the path to continue its uptrend from its $0.13 bottom on April 7, and the next target is to reach the top of the ascending channel. A critical aspect of this breakout is the reaction from the midline of the channel, which Dogecoin respected with precision before climbing again. The coin also retested the demand block between $0.1950 and $0.2150 earlier in the week. The failure to break below shows that this region has now turned into a strong structural support moving forward. As long as the price remains above this level, Dogecoin&#8217;s potential of reaching the top of the ascending channel is valid. What Targets Lie Ahead For Dogecoin? With momentum now on the side of the bulls, Melika’s analysis projects three critical levels that could serve as short profit zones for Dogecoin traders. The first target is $0.2530, which aligns with the swing high on May 11. If Dogecoin bulls maintain the price uptrend, the second target of $0.2750 could come into play. Interestingly, this target is located at the upper boundary of the ascending channel. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally – Why $1 Is Still In The Cards Beyond that lies the major horizontal resistance at $0.3035. This level is significant because it acted as a support level for Dogecoin in January. However, Dogecoin eventually went on a clean breakthrough below $0.3035 in early February, which has flipped into a zone to look out for resistance. Breaking through this area would not only signal a full recovery from the recent downtrend but also open the door to higher price levels.  However, any rejection or breakdown below $0.1950 would invalidate this bullish thesis, as it would indicate a breach of both the demand zone and the channel structure. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2447, up by 2% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from Tradingview.com",0.0665672348484848,

I know r/CryptoCurrency has plenty of Bitcoin fans (rightly so). Still, I think this feeless model is worth a quick look—constructive comments welcome.  
  
**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

Bulls remain firmly in control, and Ethereum is once again being looked to as the benchmark for broader altcoin sentiment. In a market environment now defined by Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above all-time highs, ETH is well-positioned to benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins.

ETH has also moved above its True Market Mean at $2,400, a key historical metric that aligns with strong accumulation phases. However, the final hurdle lies at the Active Realized Price, currently near $2,900. Reclaiming that level would not only confirm a major structural breakout but also signal that recent buyers are holding strong and that confidence has returned at scale.

2025-05-24T08:45:01.774150+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"Can a Currency Work Without Fees? Nano Says, ""Yes it can!""

  
I know r/CryptoCurrency has plenty of Bitcoin fans (rightly so). Still, I think this feeless model is worth a quick look—constructive comments welcome.  
  
**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

**Nano (XNO) is a cryptocurrency specifically designed to eliminate intermediaries that enrich themselves from financial transactions, a characteristic achieved primarily through its unique architecture and core features. Here's how Nano accomplishes this, positioning it as a pioneering solution in this regard:**



**1.  Feeless Transactions:**

Nano's most distinctive feature is its complete absence of transaction fees. In traditional financial systems, banks and payment processors act as middlemen, charging fees for their services. Many other cryptocurrencies also involve transaction fees, which are typically paid to miners or network validators. Nano's design circumvents this entirely. Since there are no fees to send or receive Nano, there is no mechanism for any intermediary party to ""leech off fees"" or enrich themselves directly from the act of a transaction. This makes Nano particularly suitable for all types of payments, including micro-transactions, where fees would otherwise make such transfers impractical.



**2.  Unique Architecture: Block-Lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG):**

Unlike traditional blockchain-based cryptocurrencies where all transactions are recorded on a single, continuously growing chain, Nano employs a block-lattice data structure. In this system, each account has its own individual blockchain (account-chain) that only the account owner can modify. A transaction in Nano consists of two blocks: a send block on the sender's account-chain and a receive block on the recipient's account-chain.

Nano is noted as the first cryptocurrency to use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) data structure in this specific manner, where a ""block"" consists of only one transaction and the account's current balance. This architecture is highly efficient, allowing for near-instantaneous transaction confirmations and eliminating the need for a competitive, energy-intensive mining process that often rewards miners with fees.



**3.  No Traditional Mining or Minting:**

Nano does not rely on mining, printing, or minting to secure its network or create new coins beyond its initial distribution. The total supply of Nano is fixed. This means there is no group of miners who are rewarded with newly created coins or transaction fees for validating blocks, a common model in many other cryptocurrencies where miners can be seen as a form of intermediary who profits from network operations.



**4.  Open Representative Voting (ORV) Consensus Mechanism:**

 To achieve consensus (agreement on the validity of transactions), Nano uses a system called Open Representative Voting (ORV). Users delegate their voting weight (proportional to their account balance) to representatives of their choice. These representatives then vote on the validity of transactions. Representatives do not collect fees for their services. This system is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, maintaining network security without the financial incentive of transaction fees that typically enrich middlemen in other systems.



**5.  Direct Peer-to-Peer Value Transfer:**

 The combination of the block-lattice structure and ORV allows Nano to function as a purely peer-to-peer digital currency. Value can be transferred directly from one user to another without needing to pass through, or be taxed by, intermediary entities. This design aims to ""bank the unbanked"" by allowing anyone to open an account and transfer value without requiring permission or paying dues to a third party.



**6.  Focus on Efficiency and Removing Inefficiencies:**

Nano was designed to be a lightweight and accessible digital payment protocol, with a specific focus on removing the inefficiencies present in both legacy financial infrastructure and other cryptocurrencies. These inefficiencies often include high costs and reliance on fee-collecting middlemen.

By eliminating transaction fees through its unique DAG-based block-lattice architecture and its consensus mechanism, Nano directly addresses the issue of middlemen enriching themselves from the process of value transfer. While other cryptocurrencies aim to disintermediate traditional financial institutions, many still incorporate transaction fees that benefit network participants like miners. Nano's fundamental design as a feeless protocol makes it a distinct, and in this sense, a pioneering, effort to remove this layer of enrichment from digital currency transactions. Its aim is to have a digital currency that is not run by middlemen looking to enrich themselves, but to have a currency that is used by the people for the people. 



**Some other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, operate with certain protocol characteristics that can lead to what is effectively an artificial bottleneck, impacting transaction throughput and fees.**

Bitcoin, for example, has a block size limit (historically around 1MB, though SegWit effectively increased this somewhat) and a target block creation time (approximately 10 minutes). These factors, in conjunction with its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, result in a limited transaction processing capacity, often cited as 7 transactions per second.

* **Emergence of Fee Markets:** When the number of users trying to make transactions exceeds the network's capacity to include them in the next block, a competitive ""fee market"" develops. Users must offer a transaction fee to incentivize miners to include their transaction. Transactions with higher fees are generally prioritized by miners because miners aim to maximize their revenue. This is essentially a first-price auction for block space.
* **Incentive for Validators/Miners:** In such systems, transaction fees become a significant source of income for miners, in addition to block rewards (newly minted coins). During periods of high network congestion, these fees can become substantial. Users who need their transactions confirmed quickly are compelled to pay higher fees, which directly benefits the miners processing those transactions. While the original Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned transaction fees as potentially being very low or zero, the rising popularity and the inherent throughput limitations of its Proof-of-Work design have made fee markets a persistent feature.
* **Debate on ""Artificial"" Nature:** The reasons behind such limitations, like Bitcoin's block size limit, are a subject of ongoing debate. Some argue these limits are crucial for maintaining decentralization (by keeping node operation costs manageable) and preventing blockchain bloat. Others contend that these limits are overly restrictive and create an artificial scarcity of block space, which in turn drives up fees and enriches miners. Regardless of the original intent, the consequence is that when demand outstrips the artificially constrained supply of transaction space, those who control transaction inclusion (miners/validators) can command higher prices. Machine learning models have even been developed to predict fee volatility in these markets.",0.0845394066717596,

2025-05-24T09:45:01.226967+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger. Ethereum is at a critical juncture as it approaches the $2,700 level, widely viewed as the next key resistance that bulls must overcome to confirm a bullish setup. This comes as Bitcoin broke above its all-time high yesterday, pushing the crypto market into a new phase that could unleash substantial gains across altcoins. For Ethereum, this moment could define the next leg of its recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch Since early May, ETH has surged over 55%, fueled by renewed investor confidence, broader market strength, and increasing capital rotation from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins. The sentiment is shifting, and Ethereum’s ability to lead the charge will likely influence the pace of altseason. Glassnode data highlights the improving fundamentals behind the move. In May, Ethereum reclaimed its Realized Price at $1,900—putting the average holder back in profit after a long stretch in the red. Price has also climbed above the True Market Mean at $2,400, historically seen as a reliable bullish signal. However, a clear break above $2,700 remains essential to validate this trend and attract further momentum-driven capital. Whether ETH can deliver that confirmation will shape how quickly the altcoin market gains traction in the wake of Bitcoin’s breakout. Ethereum Holds Strong As Altcoin Momentum Builds Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge as investors position themselves for what many expect to be a massive rally in the coming weeks. After months of volatility, ETH has reasserted its strength by reclaiming key technical and on-chain levels. Since crossing back above the $2,200 mark, Ethereum’s price structure has leaned decisively bullish, forming higher lows and consolidating around a critical resistance zone near $2,700. Bulls remain firmly in control, and Ethereum is once again being looked to as the benchmark for broader altcoin sentiment. In a market environment now defined by Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above all-time highs, ETH is well-positioned to benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. To fully validate a bullish continuation, however, Ethereum must break above and hold the $2,700–$2,900 range. Glassnode on-chain data adds another layer of bullish conviction. In May, Ethereum broke above its Realized Price at $1,900, putting the average holder back in profit—a milestone that typically signals renewed investor confidence. ETH has also moved above its True Market Mean at $2,400, a key historical metric that aligns with strong accumulation phases. However, the final hurdle lies at the Active Realized Price, currently near $2,900. Reclaiming that level would not only confirm a major structural breakout but also signal that recent buyers are holding strong and that confidence has returned at scale. Until then, ETH remains in a powerful setup, but the next few sessions will be critical for confirming whether the altcoin market’s leader is ready to drive the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses In Profit Nearly Doubles Since April Lows – Volatility Returns ETH Price Tests Major Resistance Ethereum continues to push higher, with price currently consolidating around the $2,665 mark after briefly touching $2,734. The daily chart shows ETH holding a clear uptrend since early May, with higher lows and strong buying volume supporting the move. All key moving averages are sloping upward, with the 34 EMA currently at $2,249 and the 50 SMA at $1,965—both well below the current price, reinforcing bullish structure. The most immediate technical challenge lies at the 200-day SMA, marked at $2,703. This long-term indicator has acted as dynamic resistance in previous cycles and will be critical to watch. A daily close above this level could trigger a breakout and confirm a broader bullish continuation, possibly opening the door toward reclaiming the $2,900–$3,000 region.

Dogecoin&#8217;s recent price action has taken a noticeably bullish turn, with the meme coin bouncing off support at the beginning of the week and steadily building upward momentum. Over the past few days, Dogecoin has been on the path to reclaiming the $0.25 level after rebounding from a low near $0.215. This upward move coincides with Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs, which has helped to inject new confidence across the broader crypto market.  Notably, technical analysis of the Dogecoin/TetherUS pair on the daily candlestick timeframe shows that the meme coin&#8217;s price has now flipped into an ascending channel headed for at least $0.3. Dogecoin Confirms Bullish Breakout As Trendline Crumbles According to a technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst Melika, Dogecoin has bounced on through a long-standing bearish trendline that had acted as a major resistance in April. This breakout is a by a clear validation of an ascending channel that has formed since late April.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Falling Wedge Breakout Puts Bulls In Charge, Target Moves Up To $0.62 The breakout indicates a full transition from bearish pressure into a bullish environment, with the price structure now leaning heavily in favor of the bulls. In this case, Dogecoin is now on the path to continue its uptrend from its $0.13 bottom on April 7, and the next target is to reach the top of the ascending channel. A critical aspect of this breakout is the reaction from the midline of the channel, which Dogecoin respected with precision before climbing again. The coin also retested the demand block between $0.1950 and $0.2150 earlier in the week. The failure to break below shows that this region has now turned into a strong structural support moving forward. As long as the price remains above this level, Dogecoin&#8217;s potential of reaching the top of the ascending channel is valid. What Targets Lie Ahead For Dogecoin? With momentum now on the side of the bulls, Melika’s analysis projects three critical levels that could serve as short profit zones for Dogecoin traders. The first target is $0.2530, which aligns with the swing high on May 11. If Dogecoin bulls maintain the price uptrend, the second target of $0.2750 could come into play.

Ethereum is at a critical juncture as it approaches the $2,700 level, widely viewed as the next key resistance that bulls must overcome to confirm a bullish setup.

For Ethereum, this moment could define the next leg of its recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch Since early May, ETH has surged over 55%, fueled by renewed investor confidence, broader market strength, and increasing capital rotation from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins. The sentiment is shifting, and Ethereum’s ability to lead the charge will likely influence the pace of altseason. Glassnode data highlights the improving fundamentals behind the move. In May, Ethereum reclaimed its Realized Price at $1,900—putting the average holder back in profit after a long stretch in the red. Price has also climbed above the True Market Mean at $2,400, historically seen as a reliable bullish signal. However, a clear break above $2,700 remains essential to validate this trend and attract further momentum-driven capital. Whether ETH can deliver that confirmation will shape how quickly the altcoin market gains traction in the wake of Bitcoin’s breakout. Ethereum Holds Strong As Altcoin Momentum Builds Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge as investors position themselves for what many expect to be a massive rally in the coming weeks. After months of volatility, ETH has reasserted its strength by reclaiming key technical and on-chain levels. Since crossing back above the $2,200 mark, Ethereum’s price structure has leaned decisively bullish, forming higher lows and consolidating around a critical resistance zone near $2,700. Bulls remain firmly in control, and Ethereum is once again being looked to as the benchmark for broader altcoin sentiment. In a market environment now defined by Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above all-time highs, ETH is well-positioned to benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. To fully validate a bullish continuation, however, Ethereum must break above and hold the $2,700–$2,900 range. Glassnode on-chain data adds another layer of bullish conviction.

2025-05-24T10:45:01.805604+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Weekly Chart Shows Bitcoin-Like Movements That Could Trigger Massive Rally. Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has highlighted a Bitcoin-like pattern on the Dogecoin chart, which could trigger a parabolic rally. Based on his analysis, this rally could send the DOGE price above $10, marking a new all-time high (ATH) for the top meme coin.  Related Reading: XRP’s $5 Dream Ride Hinges On This One Chart Setup – Analyst The Bitcoin Historical Pattern Which Could Send Dogecoin Above $10 In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10. He alluded to the weekly chart and compared the historical price cycles of Bitcoin and DOGE, while pointing out what tends to happen when BTC closes a weekly candle at all-time highs (ATHs). In the first cycle, which was in 2017, DOGE surged and achieved a 94x gain in the following months after BTC closed the week at its ATH.  In the second cycle, which was in 2020, Dogecoin witnessed a more explosive 190x rally in the following months after Bitcoin closed the week at new all-time highs. Meanwhile, again in the third cycle this year, BTC is currently trading around its ATHs. However, it needs to confirm a weekly close above this level to validate a DOGE breakout.  Based on history, DOGECAPITAL noted that this could set the stage for Dogecoin to “dramatically” outperform Bitcoin again. DOGE could also surpass its gains in previous cycles. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could even rally to as high as $69 on this explosive move.  The analyst urged market participants to watch the weekly close as the last two times Bitcoin confirmed new highs, Dogecoin didn’t just surge but “launched.” In the short term, crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the foremost meme coin could rally to $0.31. In an X post, he stated that DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which points to this target.  DOGE’s Uptrend Is Still Strong In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin’s uptrend remains pretty much solid. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin still has enough room to rally to the much-anticipated $1 price level. In another analysis, the analyst stated that DOGE will likely break the recent high at $0.25.  Meanwhile, crypto analyst Master Kenobi stated that his short-term roadmap for Dogecoin is going according to plan so far. His chart showed that he expects the meme coin to consolidate in this range for 17 days before it then breaks out and rallies to $0.75 sometime in June. This will mark a new ATH for the DOGE price, with its current all-time high at $0.73.  Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.2286, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.0757340850364106,

Ethereum Net Flows Bounce Around Net flows refer to the difference in the number of coins entering or leaving crypto exchanges over a given period of time. If net flows are positive, then it means more ETH are flowing into crypto exchanges, which could point to sell-offs are investors take advantage of the price increase.

Ethereum net flows have been mostly negative for the last week, and a continuation of this suggests bullish momentum is building up for the price. These figures show how much buying and selling could’ve been going on and how investors are viewing the digital asset right now. Ethereum Net Flows Bounce Around Net flows refer to the difference in the number of coins entering or leaving crypto exchanges over a given period of time. If net flows are positive, then it means more ETH are flowing into crypto exchanges, which could point to sell-offs are investors take advantage of the price increase. However, if net flows are negative, then it suggests that more coins are leaving exchanges than those going in. Thus, it could point to buying pressure being higher than sell-offs. Related Reading: Analyst Says This Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Contender Could See ‘Impulsive Move’ Currently, Coinglass data shows that Ethereum net flows have been skewing toward negative for a while now. 24-hour net flow volumes show a -$182.86 million figure as more coins moved out of crypto exchanges during this time. This has also persisted with six out of the last seven days showing that net flows are negative. This means that there have been more ETH leaving crypto exchanges than those going into exchanges for selling. Thus, showing that buying remains the order of the day. In this 7-day period, net flows for Ethereum are sitting at -$140 million. However, going further back, on the 15-day timeframe, investors are still skewing more toward selling. This time period shows a positive $186.48 million in net flows as well, which would explain why the Ethereum price seems suppressed despite Bitcoin making new all-time highs.. The 30-day period is no different, showing even larger deposit trends. In total, Ethereum investors have moved more ETH into crypto exchanges, causing net flows to fall to rise to $483.54 million during this time. What Could Happen To Price If Net Flows Remain Negative If the Ethereum net flows continue to remain negative and even grow from here, then it would signal a rise in buying pressure. Once the buyers are able to outbid sellers, then the Ethereum price could begin to rally again.

He alluded to the weekly chart and compared the historical price cycles of Bitcoin and DOGE, while pointing out what tends to happen when BTC closes a weekly candle at all-time highs (ATHs). In the first cycle, which was in 2017, DOGE surged and achieved a 94x gain in the following months after BTC closed the week at its ATH.  In the second cycle, which was in 2020, Dogecoin witnessed a more explosive 190x rally in the following months after Bitcoin closed the week at new all-time highs.

This has also persisted with six out of the last seven days showing that net flows are negative. This means that there have been more ETH leaving crypto exchanges than those going into exchanges for selling. Thus, showing that buying remains the order of the day. In this 7-day period, net flows for Ethereum are sitting at -$140 million. However, going further back, on the 15-day timeframe, investors are still skewing more toward selling. This time period shows a positive $186.48 million in net flows as well, which would explain why the Ethereum price seems suppressed despite Bitcoin making new all-time highs.. The 30-day period is no different, showing even larger deposit trends. In total, Ethereum investors have moved more ETH into crypto exchanges, causing net flows to fall to rise to $483.54 million during this time. What Could Happen To Price If Net Flows Remain Negative If the Ethereum net flows continue to remain negative and even grow from here, then it would signal a rise in buying pressure.

Ethereum net flows have been mostly negative for the last week, and a continuation of this suggests bullish momentum is building up for the price. These figures show how much buying and selling could’ve been going on and how investors are viewing the digital asset right now. Ethereum Net Flows Bounce Around Net flows refer to the difference in the number of coins entering or leaving crypto exchanges over a given period of time. If net flows are positive, then it means more ETH are flowing into crypto exchanges, which could point to sell-offs are investors take advantage of the price increase. However, if net flows are negative, then it suggests that more coins are leaving exchanges than those going in. Thus, it could point to buying pressure being higher than sell-offs.

This has also persisted with six out of the last seven days showing that net flows are negative. This means that there have been more ETH leaving crypto exchanges than those going into exchanges for selling. Thus, showing that buying remains the order of the day. In this 7-day period, net flows for Ethereum are sitting at -$140 million. However, going further back, on the 15-day timeframe, investors are still skewing more toward selling. This time period shows a positive $186.48 million in net flows as well, which would explain why the Ethereum price seems suppressed despite Bitcoin making new all-time highs.. The 30-day period is no different, showing even larger deposit trends. In total, Ethereum investors have moved more ETH into crypto exchanges, causing net flows to fall to rise to $483.54 million during this time. What Could Happen To Price If Net Flows Remain Negative If the Ethereum net flows continue to remain negative and even grow from here, then it would signal a rise in buying pressure.

Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has highlighted a Bitcoin-like pattern on the Dogecoin chart, which could trigger a parabolic rally. Based on his analysis, this rally could send the DOGE price above $10, marking a new all-time high (ATH) for the top meme coin.  Related Reading: XRP’s $5 Dream Ride Hinges On This One Chart Setup – Analyst The Bitcoin Historical Pattern Which Could Send Dogecoin Above $10 In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10. He alluded to the weekly chart and compared the historical price cycles of Bitcoin and DOGE, while pointing out what tends to happen when BTC closes a weekly candle at all-time highs (ATHs). In the first cycle, which was in 2017, DOGE surged and achieved a 94x gain in the following months after BTC closed the week at its ATH.  In the second cycle, which was in 2020, Dogecoin witnessed a more explosive 190x rally in the following months after Bitcoin closed the week at new all-time highs. Meanwhile, again in the third cycle this year, BTC is currently trading around its ATHs. However, it needs to confirm a weekly close above this level to validate a DOGE breakout.  Based on history, DOGECAPITAL noted that this could set the stage for Dogecoin to “dramatically” outperform Bitcoin again. DOGE could also surpass its gains in previous cycles. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could even rally to as high as $69 on this explosive move.  The analyst urged market participants to watch the weekly close as the last two times Bitcoin confirmed new highs, Dogecoin didn’t just surge but “launched.” In the short term, crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the foremost meme coin could rally to $0.31. In an X post, he stated that DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which points to this target.  DOGE’s Uptrend Is Still Strong In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin’s uptrend remains pretty much solid. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin still has enough room to rally to the much-anticipated $1 price level.

2025-05-24T20:45:01.284341+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500. Ethereum net flows have been mostly negative for the last week, and a continuation of this suggests bullish momentum is building up for the price. These figures show how much buying and selling could’ve been going on and how investors are viewing the digital asset right now. Ethereum Net Flows Bounce Around Net flows refer to the difference in the number of coins entering or leaving crypto exchanges over a given period of time. If net flows are positive, then it means more ETH are flowing into crypto exchanges, which could point to sell-offs are investors take advantage of the price increase. However, if net flows are negative, then it suggests that more coins are leaving exchanges than those going in. Thus, it could point to buying pressure being higher than sell-offs. Related Reading: Analyst Says This Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Contender Could See ‘Impulsive Move’ Currently, Coinglass data shows that Ethereum net flows have been skewing toward negative for a while now. 24-hour net flow volumes show a -$182.86 million figure as more coins moved out of crypto exchanges during this time. This has also persisted with six out of the last seven days showing that net flows are negative. This means that there have been more ETH leaving crypto exchanges than those going into exchanges for selling. Thus, showing that buying remains the order of the day. In this 7-day period, net flows for Ethereum are sitting at -$140 million. However, going further back, on the 15-day timeframe, investors are still skewing more toward selling. This time period shows a positive $186.48 million in net flows as well, which would explain why the Ethereum price seems suppressed despite Bitcoin making new all-time highs.. The 30-day period is no different, showing even larger deposit trends. In total, Ethereum investors have moved more ETH into crypto exchanges, causing net flows to fall to rise to $483.54 million during this time. What Could Happen To Price If Net Flows Remain Negative If the Ethereum net flows continue to remain negative and even grow from here, then it would signal a rise in buying pressure. Once the buyers are able to outbid sellers, then the Ethereum price could begin to rally again.

Now, if they are able to capture this level and break out of it, the analyst sees the price rising above $3,500 in the near term. &#160; Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0861204250295159,

Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has highlighted a Bitcoin-like pattern on the Dogecoin chart, which could trigger a parabolic rally. Based on his analysis, this rally could send the DOGE price above $10, marking a new all-time high (ATH) for the top meme coin.  Related Reading: XRP’s $5 Dream Ride Hinges On This One Chart Setup – Analyst The Bitcoin Historical Pattern Which Could Send Dogecoin Above $10 In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10. He alluded to the weekly chart and compared the historical price cycles of Bitcoin and DOGE, while pointing out what tends to happen when BTC closes a weekly candle at all-time highs (ATHs). In the first cycle, which was in 2017, DOGE surged and achieved a 94x gain in the following months after BTC closed the week at its ATH.  In the second cycle, which was in 2020, Dogecoin witnessed a more explosive 190x rally in the following months after Bitcoin closed the week at new all-time highs. Meanwhile, again in the third cycle this year, BTC is currently trading around its ATHs. However, it needs to confirm a weekly close above this level to validate a DOGE breakout.  Based on history, DOGECAPITAL noted that this could set the stage for Dogecoin to “dramatically” outperform Bitcoin again. DOGE could also surpass its gains in previous cycles. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could even rally to as high as $69 on this explosive move.  The analyst urged market participants to watch the weekly close as the last two times Bitcoin confirmed new highs, Dogecoin didn’t just surge but “launched.” In the short term, crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the foremost meme coin could rally to $0.31. In an X post, he stated that DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which points to this target.  DOGE’s Uptrend Is Still Strong In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin’s uptrend remains pretty much solid. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin still has enough room to rally to the much-anticipated $1 price level. In another analysis, the analyst stated that DOGE will likely break the recent high at $0.25.  Meanwhile, crypto analyst Master Kenobi stated that his short-term roadmap for Dogecoin is going according to plan so far. His chart showed that he expects the meme coin to consolidate in this range for 17 days before it then breaks out and rallies to $0.75 sometime in June. This will mark a new ATH for the DOGE price, with its current all-time high at $0.73.  Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.2286, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.0757340850364106,

In the first cycle, which was in 2017, DOGE surged and achieved a 94x gain in the following months after BTC closed the week at its ATH.  In the second cycle, which was in 2020, Dogecoin witnessed a more explosive 190x rally in the following months after Bitcoin closed the week at new all-time highs. Meanwhile, again in the third cycle this year, BTC is currently trading around its ATHs. However, it needs to confirm a weekly close above this level to validate a DOGE breakout.  Based on history, DOGECAPITAL noted that this could set the stage for Dogecoin to “dramatically” outperform Bitcoin again. DOGE could also surpass its gains in previous cycles. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could even rally to as high as $69 on this explosive move.  The analyst urged market participants to watch the weekly close as the last two times Bitcoin confirmed new highs, Dogecoin didn’t just surge but “launched.” In the short term, crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the foremost meme coin could rally to $0.31. In an X post, he stated that DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which points to this target.  DOGE’s Uptrend Is Still Strong In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin’s uptrend remains pretty much solid. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin still has enough room to rally to the much-anticipated $1 price level. In another analysis, the analyst stated that DOGE will likely break the recent high at $0.25.  Meanwhile, crypto analyst Master Kenobi stated that his short-term roadmap for Dogecoin is going according to plan so far. His chart showed that he expects the meme coin to consolidate in this range for 17 days before it then breaks out and rallies to $0.75 sometime in June. This will mark a new ATH for the DOGE price, with its current all-time high at $0.73.  Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.2286, down over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.0757340850364106,

However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches.</p><p>The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/long-and-short-positions-explained"" title=""null"">short (sell) positions</a>. Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.</p><p><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-record-month-1-5b-inflows-2-days"" title=""null"">Net inflows of $1.9 billion</a> into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust. Ultimately, bears&rsquo; main hope lies in a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could increase risk aversion and reduce demand for Bitcoin.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hits-new-highs-in-the-absence-of-unhealthy-leverage-use-will-the-rally-continue"" title=""null""><em><strong>Bitcoin hits new highs in the absence of &lsquo;unhealthy&rsquo; leverage use &mdash; Will the rally continue?</strong></em></a></p><h2>Bitcoin bulls aim for $110,000 by May 30</h2><p>Below are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Between $102k and $105k:</strong> $2.75 billion in calls (buy) vs. $900 million in puts (sell).

However, the ongoing bullish momentum depends on developments in the ongoing tariff war, which has been a key focus in recent weeks.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T11:45:01.261392+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Nears $2,800 Break-Even Zone: Why This Is Important For Rally To $3,000. Ethereum’s recent price momentum, along with the rest of the market, kept investors on edge during the week as it pressed closer toward the $2,800 level. However, Ethereum struggled to push past $2,750 during the week, briefly hitting resistance as bulls tried to extend the current uptrend.  Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this may be a reaction to a major cluster of buy levels around $2,800, which may increase sell-side pressure in the coming days. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says $2,800 Zone Heats Up With Investor Cost Basis Cluster After rebounding from a low near $1,600 in April, Ethereum recovered more than half of its losses last week from its peak near $3,800 in December 2024. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, there is a significant accumulation of Ethereum supply held by investors who bought in near the $2,800 price range. This concentration, visualized in Glassnode’s cost-basis heatmap, shows a notable density of wallet activity precisely at this level.  The implication of this concentration is simple: a large number of ETH holders who have been underwater since early 2025 are finally seeing a chance to exit at breakeven as the Ethereum price approaches $2,800. As such, selling pressure may increase as the Ethereum price approaches this level. The logic is that these investors who have been underwater may use this rally to secure neutral exits. That sort of sell-side pressure can act as a cap on the rally, unless demand is strong enough to absorb the supply hitting the market.  The heatmap below shows a large cluster of supply density just below $2,800, which Ethereum must decisively overcome to continue its path toward reclaiming $3,000.  Image From Glassnode Some Resistance Above, But Strong Support Below Given the possibility of the $2,800 level acting as a challenging price ceiling during the week, different on-chain data shows Ethereum enjoying strong support beneath the current price level.  According to a post on X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, blockchain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that Ethereum holders have built a robust demand zone between $2,330 and $2,410. This area hosts 2.58 million addresses holding over 63.65 million ETH, making it an important support floor. Image From X: @ali_charts At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. The current price range puts the price of the largest altcoin squarely between a band of selling pressure overhead and a solid cushion of demand below.  Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Interestingly, there are no significant resistance walls aside from the cost basis levels around $2,800, meaning that a convincing breakout above $2,800 could push the Ethereum price quickly towards $3,000. The balance of probabilities now rests on whether bullish momentum can break through the resistance cluster or whether a pullback toward the $2,370 zone will reset the rally.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1487166497804795,

Ethereum has reached a new milestone with a record-breaking throughput of 78.82 million gas per second.

Ethereum’s recent price momentum, along with the rest of the market, kept investors on edge during the week as it pressed closer toward the $2,800 level. However, Ethereum struggled to push past $2,750 during the week, briefly hitting resistance as bulls tried to extend the current uptrend.  Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this may be a reaction to a major cluster of buy levels around $2,800, which may increase sell-side pressure in the coming days. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says $2,800 Zone Heats Up With Investor Cost Basis Cluster After rebounding from a low near $1,600 in April, Ethereum recovered more than half of its losses last week from its peak near $3,800 in December 2024. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, there is a significant accumulation of Ethereum supply held by investors who bought in near the $2,800 price range. This concentration, visualized in Glassnode’s cost-basis heatmap, shows a notable density of wallet activity precisely at this level.  The implication of this concentration is simple: a large number of ETH holders who have been underwater since early 2025 are finally seeing a chance to exit at breakeven as the Ethereum price approaches $2,800. As such, selling pressure may increase as the Ethereum price approaches this level. The logic is that these investors who have been underwater may use this rally to secure neutral exits. That sort of sell-side pressure can act as a cap on the rally, unless demand is strong enough to absorb the supply hitting the market.  The heatmap below shows a large cluster of supply density just below $2,800, which Ethereum must decisively overcome to continue its path toward reclaiming $3,000.  Image From Glassnode Some Resistance Above, But Strong Support Below Given the possibility of the $2,800 level acting as a challenging price ceiling during the week, different on-chain data shows Ethereum enjoying strong support beneath the current price level.  According to a post on X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, blockchain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that Ethereum holders have built a robust demand zone between $2,330 and $2,410. This area hosts 2.58 million addresses holding over 63.65 million ETH, making it an important support floor. Image From X: @ali_charts At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. The current price range puts the price of the largest altcoin squarely between a band of selling pressure overhead and a solid cushion of demand below.  Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Interestingly, there are no significant resistance walls aside from the cost basis levels around $2,800, meaning that a convincing breakout above $2,800 could push the Ethereum price quickly towards $3,000. The balance of probabilities now rests on whether bullish momentum can break through the resistance cluster or whether a pullback toward the $2,370 zone will reset the rally.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1487166497804795,

2025-05-25T17:45:01.773758+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Nears $2,800 Break-Even Zone: Why This Is Important For Rally To $3,000. Ethereum’s recent price momentum, along with the rest of the market, kept investors on edge during the week as it pressed closer toward the $2,800 level. However, Ethereum struggled to push past $2,750 during the week, briefly hitting resistance as bulls tried to extend the current uptrend.  Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this may be a reaction to a major cluster of buy levels around $2,800, which may increase sell-side pressure in the coming days. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says $2,800 Zone Heats Up With Investor Cost Basis Cluster After rebounding from a low near $1,600 in April, Ethereum recovered more than half of its losses last week from its peak near $3,800 in December 2024. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, there is a significant accumulation of Ethereum supply held by investors who bought in near the $2,800 price range. This concentration, visualized in Glassnode’s cost-basis heatmap, shows a notable density of wallet activity precisely at this level.  The implication of this concentration is simple: a large number of ETH holders who have been underwater since early 2025 are finally seeing a chance to exit at breakeven as the Ethereum price approaches $2,800. As such, selling pressure may increase as the Ethereum price approaches this level. The logic is that these investors who have been underwater may use this rally to secure neutral exits. That sort of sell-side pressure can act as a cap on the rally, unless demand is strong enough to absorb the supply hitting the market.  The heatmap below shows a large cluster of supply density just below $2,800, which Ethereum must decisively overcome to continue its path toward reclaiming $3,000.  Image From Glassnode Some Resistance Above, But Strong Support Below Given the possibility of the $2,800 level acting as a challenging price ceiling during the week, different on-chain data shows Ethereum enjoying strong support beneath the current price level.  According to a post on X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, blockchain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that Ethereum holders have built a robust demand zone between $2,330 and $2,410. This area hosts 2.58 million addresses holding over 63.65 million ETH, making it an important support floor. Image From X: @ali_charts At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. The current price range puts the price of the largest altcoin squarely between a band of selling pressure overhead and a solid cushion of demand below.  Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Interestingly, there are no significant resistance walls aside from the cost basis levels around $2,800, meaning that a convincing breakout above $2,800 could push the Ethereum price quickly towards $3,000. The balance of probabilities now rests on whether bullish momentum can break through the resistance cluster or whether a pullback toward the $2,370 zone will reset the rally.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1487166497804795,

Ethereum’s recent price momentum, along with the rest of the market, kept investors on edge during the week as it pressed closer toward the $2,800 level. However, Ethereum struggled to push past $2,750 during the week, briefly hitting resistance as bulls tried to extend the current uptrend.  Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this may be a reaction to a major cluster of buy levels around $2,800, which may increase sell-side pressure in the coming days. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says $2,800 Zone Heats Up With Investor Cost Basis Cluster After rebounding from a low near $1,600 in April, Ethereum recovered more than half of its losses last week from its peak near $3,800 in December 2024. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, there is a significant accumulation of Ethereum supply held by investors who bought in near the $2,800 price range. This concentration, visualized in Glassnode’s cost-basis heatmap, shows a notable density of wallet activity precisely at this level.  The implication of this concentration is simple: a large number of ETH holders who have been underwater since early 2025 are finally seeing a chance to exit at breakeven as the Ethereum price approaches $2,800. As such, selling pressure may increase as the Ethereum price approaches this level. The logic is that these investors who have been underwater may use this rally to secure neutral exits. That sort of sell-side pressure can act as a cap on the rally, unless demand is strong enough to absorb the supply hitting the market.  The heatmap below shows a large cluster of supply density just below $2,800, which Ethereum must decisively overcome to continue its path toward reclaiming $3,000.  Image From Glassnode Some Resistance Above, But Strong Support Below Given the possibility of the $2,800 level acting as a challenging price ceiling during the week, different on-chain data shows Ethereum enjoying strong support beneath the current price level.  According to a post on X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, blockchain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that Ethereum holders have built a robust demand zone between $2,330 and $2,410. This area hosts 2.58 million addresses holding over 63.65 million ETH, making it an important support floor. Image From X: @ali_charts At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. The current price range puts the price of the largest altcoin squarely between a band of selling pressure overhead and a solid cushion of demand below.  Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Interestingly, there are no significant resistance walls aside from the cost basis levels around $2,800, meaning that a convincing breakout above $2,800 could push the Ethereum price quickly towards $3,000. The balance of probabilities now rests on whether bullish momentum can break through the resistance cluster or whether a pullback toward the $2,370 zone will reset the rally.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1487166497804795,

Ethereum’s recent price momentum, along with the rest of the market, kept investors on edge during the week as it pressed closer toward the $2,800 level. However, Ethereum struggled to push past $2,750 during the week, briefly hitting resistance as bulls tried to extend the current uptrend.  Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this may be a reaction to a major cluster of buy levels around $2,800, which may increase sell-side pressure in the coming days. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says $2,800 Zone Heats Up With Investor Cost Basis Cluster After rebounding from a low near $1,600 in April, Ethereum recovered more than half of its losses last week from its peak near $3,800 in December 2024. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, there is a significant accumulation of Ethereum supply held by investors who bought in near the $2,800 price range. This concentration, visualized in Glassnode’s cost-basis heatmap, shows a notable density of wallet activity precisely at this level.  The implication of this concentration is simple: a large number of ETH holders who have been underwater since early 2025 are finally seeing a chance to exit at breakeven as the Ethereum price approaches $2,800. As such, selling pressure may increase as the Ethereum price approaches this level. The logic is that these investors who have been underwater may use this rally to secure neutral exits. That sort of sell-side pressure can act as a cap on the rally, unless demand is strong enough to absorb the supply hitting the market.  The heatmap below shows a large cluster of supply density just below $2,800, which Ethereum must decisively overcome to continue its path toward reclaiming $3,000.  Image From Glassnode Some Resistance Above, But Strong Support Below Given the possibility of the $2,800 level acting as a challenging price ceiling during the week, different on-chain data shows Ethereum enjoying strong support beneath the current price level.  According to a post on X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, blockchain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that Ethereum holders have built a robust demand zone between $2,330 and $2,410.

Ethereum’s recent price momentum, along with the rest of the market, kept investors on edge during the week as it pressed closer toward the $2,800 level. However, Ethereum struggled to push past $2,750 during the week, briefly hitting resistance as bulls tried to extend the current uptrend.  Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this may be a reaction to a major cluster of buy levels around $2,800, which may increase sell-side pressure in the coming days. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says $2,800 Zone Heats Up With Investor Cost Basis Cluster After rebounding from a low near $1,600 in April, Ethereum recovered more than half of its losses last week from its peak near $3,800 in December 2024. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, there is a significant accumulation of Ethereum supply held by investors who bought in near the $2,800 price range. This concentration, visualized in Glassnode’s cost-basis heatmap, shows a notable density of wallet activity precisely at this level.  The implication of this concentration is simple: a large number of ETH holders who have been underwater since early 2025 are finally seeing a chance to exit at breakeven as the Ethereum price approaches $2,800. As such, selling pressure may increase as the Ethereum price approaches this level. The logic is that these investors who have been underwater may use this rally to secure neutral exits. That sort of sell-side pressure can act as a cap on the rally, unless demand is strong enough to absorb the supply hitting the market.  The heatmap below shows a large cluster of supply density just below $2,800, which Ethereum must decisively overcome to continue its path toward reclaiming $3,000.  Image From Glassnode Some Resistance Above, But Strong Support Below Given the possibility of the $2,800 level acting as a challenging price ceiling during the week, different on-chain data shows Ethereum enjoying strong support beneath the current price level.  According to a post on X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, blockchain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that Ethereum holders have built a robust demand zone between $2,330 and $2,410. This area hosts 2.58 million addresses holding over 63.65 million ETH, making it an important support floor. Image From X: @ali_charts At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. The current price range puts the price of the largest altcoin squarely between a band of selling pressure overhead and a solid cushion of demand below.  Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Interestingly, there are no significant resistance walls aside from the cost basis levels around $2,800, meaning that a convincing breakout above $2,800 could push the Ethereum price quickly towards $3,000. The balance of probabilities now rests on whether bullish momentum can break through the resistance cluster or whether a pullback toward the $2,370 zone will reset the rally.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1487166497804795,

2025-05-26T02:45:01.795687+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Nears $2,800 Break-Even Zone: Why This Is Important For Rally To $3,000. Ethereum’s recent price momentum, along with the rest of the market, kept investors on edge during the week as it pressed closer toward the $2,800 level. However, Ethereum struggled to push past $2,750 during the week, briefly hitting resistance as bulls tried to extend the current uptrend.  Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this may be a reaction to a major cluster of buy levels around $2,800, which may increase sell-side pressure in the coming days. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says $2,800 Zone Heats Up With Investor Cost Basis Cluster After rebounding from a low near $1,600 in April, Ethereum recovered more than half of its losses last week from its peak near $3,800 in December 2024. According to on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, there is a significant accumulation of Ethereum supply held by investors who bought in near the $2,800 price range. This concentration, visualized in Glassnode’s cost-basis heatmap, shows a notable density of wallet activity precisely at this level.  The implication of this concentration is simple: a large number of ETH holders who have been underwater since early 2025 are finally seeing a chance to exit at breakeven as the Ethereum price approaches $2,800. As such, selling pressure may increase as the Ethereum price approaches this level. The logic is that these investors who have been underwater may use this rally to secure neutral exits. That sort of sell-side pressure can act as a cap on the rally, unless demand is strong enough to absorb the supply hitting the market.  The heatmap below shows a large cluster of supply density just below $2,800, which Ethereum must decisively overcome to continue its path toward reclaiming $3,000.  Image From Glassnode Some Resistance Above, But Strong Support Below Given the possibility of the $2,800 level acting as a challenging price ceiling during the week, different on-chain data shows Ethereum enjoying strong support beneath the current price level.  According to a post on X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, blockchain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that Ethereum holders have built a robust demand zone between $2,330 and $2,410. This area hosts 2.58 million addresses holding over 63.65 million ETH, making it an important support floor. Image From X: @ali_charts At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. The current price range puts the price of the largest altcoin squarely between a band of selling pressure overhead and a solid cushion of demand below.  Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Interestingly, there are no significant resistance walls aside from the cost basis levels around $2,800, meaning that a convincing breakout above $2,800 could push the Ethereum price quickly towards $3,000. The balance of probabilities now rests on whether bullish momentum can break through the resistance cluster or whether a pullback toward the $2,370 zone will reset the rally.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1487166497804795,

Hello everybody!  Happy holiday weekend (in the USA).  I wanted significant exposure to Bitcoin.  I have cold wallets and know how to use them, but I wanted to purchase using after tax Roth money to avoid tax exposure.  So, I bought $500k of the Van Eck Bitcoin ETF using my Roth 401k account.  It was an impulse buy and I didn’t study any of the other bitcoin ETFs.  For those of you who have, is there much of a difference?  

Also, has anyone ran into problems buying shares of a bitcoin ETF using self-directed traditional 401k account?

The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period.  Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500 Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark &#8211; Analyst In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum’s price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month. In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern. According to Ted Pillows’ analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks.  However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price.

Hello everybody!  Happy holiday weekend (in the USA).  I wanted significant exposure to Bitcoin.  I have cold wallets and know how to use them, but I wanted to purchase using after tax Roth money to avoid tax exposure.  So, I bought $500k of the Van Eck Bitcoin ETF using my Roth 401k account.

2025-05-26T05:45:01.793586+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Bullish Pattern Points To Immediate $3,000 Target – Details. The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period.  Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500 Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark &#8211; Analyst In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum’s price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month. In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern. According to Ted Pillows’ analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks.  However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price.

The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period.  Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500 Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark &#8211; Analyst In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum’s price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month. In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern. According to Ted Pillows’ analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks.  However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price.

Hello everybody!  Happy holiday weekend (in the USA).  I wanted significant exposure to Bitcoin.  I have cold wallets and know how to use them, but I wanted to purchase using after tax Roth money to avoid tax exposure.  So, I bought $500k of the Van Eck Bitcoin ETF using my Roth 401k account.  It was an impulse buy and I didn’t study any of the other bitcoin ETFs.  For those of you who have, is there much of a difference?  

Also, has anyone ran into problems buying shares of a bitcoin ETF using self-directed traditional 401k account?

2025-05-26T08:45:09.374741+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Bullish Pattern Points To Immediate $3,000 Target – Details. The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period.  Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500 Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark &#8211; Analyst In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum’s price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month. In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern. According to Ted Pillows’ analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks.  However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price.

Nevertheless, Ethereum’s price has shown much resilience with no significant decline in response. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview",0.0414935816498316,

The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period.  Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500 Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark &#8211; Analyst In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum’s price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month. In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern. According to Ted Pillows’ analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks.  However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price.

Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.</p><p>Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin&rsquo;s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and  ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.</p><h2>Why are US Treasury yields so important?</h2><p>When US <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-the-10-year-treasury-yield-means-for-crypto-yields-and-stablecoins"" title=""null"">bond yields</a> rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply &mdash; a critical issue given that <a href=""https://www.usdebtclock.org/"" title=""null"">US debt</a> has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.</p><p>US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.</p><p>Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government&rsquo;s<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ignores-moody-s-us-debt-downgrade-rallies-back-to-105k-after-profit-taking-sell-off"" title=""null""> last AAA credit rating</a> is a stark confirmation.</p><h2>The worrying yield surge in the US and Japan</h2><p>On May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% &mdash; its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break &mdash; Here&rsquo;s why"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196fe70-1241-74f8-95e0-5ddb622e768a"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>For the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a &ldquo;higher for longer&rdquo; rate environment.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hit-a-new-all-time-high-and-data-shows-btc-bulls-aren-t-done-yet"" title=""null""><em><strong>Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren&rsquo;t done yet</strong></em></a></p><p>Compounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold <a href=""https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/slt_table5.html"" title=""null"">$1.13 trillion</a> in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks &mdash; a strategy known as the carry trade.</p><p>This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999.&nbsp;</p><p>On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-19/ishiba-rebuffs-tax-cut-demands-with-greek-debt-comparison"" title=""null"">warned</a> the country&rsquo;s parliament that his debt-strapped government&rsquo;s position was &ldquo;worse than Greece&rdquo; &mdash; a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break &mdash; Here&rsquo;s why"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196fe70-b48f-7fd8-9a08-4749efa5cae1"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG Datastream</em></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn&rsquo;t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/japans-portfolio-reshuffle-raises-red-flag-us-mike-dolan-2025-05-21/"" title=""null"">Reuters</a> noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan &ldquo;normalizes&rdquo; interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.</p><h2>Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?</h2><p>As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.</p><p>Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on.&nbsp;</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.</p><figure><img alt=""Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break &mdash; Here&rsquo;s why"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196fe71-3bb1-7451-897e-90c8b3cc6b91"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><em>FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global Research</em></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, according to <a href=""https://www.coinglass.com/bitcoin-etf"" title=""null"">CoinGlass</a>, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold&rsquo;s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.</p><p>Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin&rsquo;s once-contradictory narratives: It is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what&rsquo;s to come.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T11:45:01.820610+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Bullish Pattern Points To Immediate $3,000 Target – Details. The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period.  Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500 Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark &#8211; Analyst In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum’s price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month. In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern. According to Ted Pillows’ analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks.  However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price.

2025-05-26T11:45:01.820610+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

2025-05-26T13:45:01.275575+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Bullish Pattern Points To Immediate $3,000 Target – Details. The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period.  Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500 Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark &#8211; Analyst In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum’s price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month. In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern. According to Ted Pillows’ analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks.  However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price. Related Reading: Market Expert Projects ‘Undervalued’ Litecoin To Soar At Least 1,000% — Here’s How Ethereum Market Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,500 after a 0.34% gain in the past day.

2025-05-26T13:45:01.275575+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

2025-05-26T14:45:01.874342+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

2025-05-26T15:45:01.277919+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"How Much Bitcoin Do CEXs Keep in Their Reserves?

In the wake of the new $111k Bitcoin ATH I was checking some odd BTC statistics and i saw a statement about CEXs BTC PoR ratio.

When Gateio introduced **Proof of Reserve (PoR)** it wasn't really taken seriously until after the disasters FTX... then attention shifted and questions were asked if & where CEXs stash their digital cash.

PoR have been a good measure of transparency standards of CEXs in recent times and digging deeper, the top five that published their PoR have above 100%, which is a win for anyone using them.

https://preview.redd.it/bji0k1kxx33f1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea18674e4516990e05ba54a380af2bb493aa17a7

Binance is just over the line at 100.77%, while OKX and MEXC show solid buffers at 114% and 117.53%. Bybit’s 104.4% is also reassuring.

But then there’s **Bitget**, with insane 369%, it’s like they’re shouting....  
“We’ve got you covered""  
“We’ve got you covered""  
“We’ve got you covered"" + 69%...

As crypto grows up, I expect PoR to become a must-have, not a bonus. For now, it’s cool to see these big names leading the charge.

What are your thoughts about CEXs BTC reserve?

Ohh i couldn't find any thing about Coinbase really... any ideas about theirs guys? I only saw cbBTC, can i add it to this chart? Why do you think Bitget wet above and beyond?",0.0782296650717703,

Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

In the wake of the new $111k Bitcoin ATH I was checking some odd BTC statistics and i saw a statement about CEXs BTC PoR ratio.

When Gateio introduced **Proof of Reserve (PoR)** it wasn't really taken seriously until after the disasters FTX... then attention shifted and questions were asked if & where CEXs stash their digital cash.

PoR have been a good measure of transparency standards of CEXs in recent times and digging deeper, the top five that published their PoR have above 100%, which is a win for anyone using them.

Binance is just over the line at 100.77%, while OKX and MEXC show solid buffers at 114% and 117.53%. Bybit’s 104.4% is also reassuring.

As crypto grows up, I expect PoR to become a must-have, not a bonus. For now, it’s cool to see these big names leading the charge.

They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques.

Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Volume profile</h2><p>Volume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Elliot Wave Theory</h2><p>The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-elliott-wave-theory-and-how-to-use-it-in-crypto"" title=""null"">Elliott Wave theory</a> is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.</p><h2>4. Other indicators</h2><ul><li><p>The<strong> relative strength index (RSI)</strong> is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin&rsquo;s upward and downward price movements over time.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>simple moving average (SMA)</strong> indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin&rsquo;s overall price movement.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The <strong>exponential moving average (EMA)</strong> is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.</p></li></ul><p>Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don&rsquo;t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term.&nbsp;</p><p>They represent Bitcoin&rsquo;s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.</p><p>Why use candlesticks?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>They help traders visualize price movements over time.</p></li><li><p>They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.</p></li><li><p>They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.</p></li></ul><figure><img alt=""candlestick-chart-pattern"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/01970cb0-122e-7d59-9410-dbbe2230ac11"" title="""" /></figure><p>A candlestick represents four key price points:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>opening</strong> price at the start of the period</p></li><li><p>The <strong>closing</strong> price at the end of the period</p></li><li><p>The <strong>highest</strong> price reached during the period</p></li><li><p>The <strong>lowest</strong> price reached during the period.</p></li></ul><p>A candlestick is formed of a <strong>body</strong>, the bulky part between the open and close prices.&nbsp;</p><p>It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.</p><p>The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it&rsquo;s long. It indicates uncertainty when it&rsquo;s short.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=""various parts of candlestick charts"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/01970cad-3931-77a4-b1af-8b8dbfa7ce75"" title=""various parts of candlestick charts"" /></figure><p>A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you&rsquo;re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin&rsquo;s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700.&nbsp;</p><p>In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.</p><h2>Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart&nbsp;</h2><p>Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:</p><ul><li><p>Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you&rsquo;re a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/day-trading-vs-long-term-cryptocurrency-hodling-benefits-and-drawbacks"" title=""null"">day trader, swing trader or long-term investor</a>.</p></li></ul><p>For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors.&nbsp;</p><p>As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.</p><h2>Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTC</h2><p>Candlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-ways-traders-use-moving-averages-to-read-market-momentum"" title=""null"">using moving averages</a> can help you make better investing decisions.</p><figure><img alt=""moving average example"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/01970cb2-b86b-77f0-9b26-a8018aa48fb3"" title=""moving average example"" /></figure><p>Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.</p><h2>1. Fibonacci retracement&nbsp;</h2><p>Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=""fibonacci retracement example"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/01970cb4-1d6a-7edf-aab9-4a6c98158131"" title=""fibonacci retracement example"" /></figure><p>To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Volume profile</h2><p>Volume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Elliot Wave Theory</h2><p>The <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-elliott-wave-theory-and-how-to-use-it-in-crypto"" title=""null"">Elliott Wave theory</a> is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.</p><h2>4. Other indicators</h2><ul><li><p>The<strong> relative strength index (RSI)</strong> is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin&rsquo;s upward and downward price movements over time.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>simple moving average (SMA)</strong> indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin&rsquo;s overall price movement.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The <strong>exponential moving average (EMA)</strong> is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.</p></li></ul><p>Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don&rsquo;t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Solana (SOL) is once again in the spotlight, as a market analyst has forecasted a massive rally that could propel the token’s price to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) by late 2025. The prediction suggests a staggering 140% surge from current levels toward a bold price target of $420 and beyond. Solana Prepares For Parabolic Move Toward $420 A fresh chart analysis shared by a TradingView crypto analyst, Master Ananda, reports that Solana has completed a textbook rounded bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal to new ATHs. Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target.  Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025. This pattern has now transitioned into a breakout structure, with the Solana price reportedly holding firm above the $160 support line — a level considered the baseline of the rounded bottom and a psychological stronghold for the market.  Notably, Solana faced a strong rejection at a key resistance area on May 23. However, despite the pullback, Master Ananda emphasized that the price action remains resilient, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact and the dip has not altered the altcoin’s positive long-term outlook in the months ahead.  In addition, Solana also dropped to a low on May 19, marked by the blue line on the price chart. Despite this, the analyst strongly asserts that there is “absolutely no bearish action” on the current chart.  As long as the $160 level holds, the current trend is likely to accelerate toward higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $419.78. This bullish target would represent approximately 140% growth from the current price of around $178 and would place Solana at a new all-time high.  Interestingly, Master Ananda noted that even if Solana falls below the key support level, it would be of little concern. Such a move would likely signal a market shakeout or a bear trap rather than a pullback or an invalidation of Solana’s bullish thesis. This view stems from the belief that SOL’s bullish bias has already been confirmed, positioning the market for potential strong growth over the long term.  The key point of Master Ananda’s analysis is that Solana’s rise is expected to be sudden and powerful, leaving those on the sidelines regretting missed opportunities. As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated.  Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly. Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way The analyst suggests that Solana’s current price levels, while not at absolute lows, still represent a significant buy zone. Master Ananda revealed that Solana’s potential is substantial, and as the next bull cycle gains momentum, $300 will no longer be seen as expensive. Before this happens, Master Ananda has stated that investors “should be fully invested and buy like it’s the end of the world”.

2025-05-26T17:45:09.323987+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

2025-05-26T19:03:05.219469+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs. Solana (SOL) is once again in the spotlight, as a market analyst has forecasted a massive rally that could propel the token’s price to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) by late 2025. The prediction suggests a staggering 140% surge from current levels toward a bold price target of $420 and beyond. Solana Prepares For Parabolic Move Toward $420 A fresh chart analysis shared by a TradingView crypto analyst, Master Ananda, reports that Solana has completed a textbook rounded bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal to new ATHs. Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target.  Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025. This pattern has now transitioned into a breakout structure, with the Solana price reportedly holding firm above the $160 support line — a level considered the baseline of the rounded bottom and a psychological stronghold for the market.  Notably, Solana faced a strong rejection at a key resistance area on May 23. However, despite the pullback, Master Ananda emphasized that the price action remains resilient, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact and the dip has not altered the altcoin’s positive long-term outlook in the months ahead.  In addition, Solana also dropped to a low on May 19, marked by the blue line on the price chart. Despite this, the analyst strongly asserts that there is “absolutely no bearish action” on the current chart.  As long as the $160 level holds, the current trend is likely to accelerate toward higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $419.78. This bullish target would represent approximately 140% growth from the current price of around $178 and would place Solana at a new all-time high.  Interestingly, Master Ananda noted that even if Solana falls below the key support level, it would be of little concern. Such a move would likely signal a market shakeout or a bear trap rather than a pullback or an invalidation of Solana’s bullish thesis. This view stems from the belief that SOL’s bullish bias has already been confirmed, positioning the market for potential strong growth over the long term.  The key point of Master Ananda’s analysis is that Solana’s rise is expected to be sudden and powerful, leaving those on the sidelines regretting missed opportunities. As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated.  Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly. Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way The analyst suggests that Solana’s current price levels, while not at absolute lows, still represent a significant buy zone. Master Ananda revealed that Solana’s potential is substantial, and as the next bull cycle gains momentum, $300 will no longer be seen as expensive. Before this happens, Master Ananda has stated that investors “should be fully invested and buy like it’s the end of the world”.

2025-05-26T19:03:05.219469+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated.  Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly. Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way The analyst suggests that Solana’s current price levels, while not at absolute lows, still represent a significant buy zone. Master Ananda revealed that Solana’s potential is substantial, and as the next bull cycle gains momentum, $300 will no longer be seen as expensive. Before this happens, Master Ananda has stated that investors “should be fully invested and buy like it’s the end of the world”.

2025-05-26T19:45:01.267521+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

Hi, people, do you believe in alt season in this cycle? 

I've been in crypto for a few years now and have seen how the market tends to follow certain patterns — especially the infamous ""alt season"" that usually follows a Bitcoin run. But here we are in May 2025, and despite BTC reaching new highs earlier this year, there's been almost no real sign of an altcoin season.

I have my doubts about this, my felling is pessimist. We are in May and nothing signal for a big pump in alt coins. The closest we got to this was in December, when a big pump in IA and Agent IA. 

I wanna know about you what’s your opinion about this, if we have a altcoin season, if haven’t a alto in season or if you, like me, don’t have a clearly opinion?

edit1: thanks everyone, after reading all the comments I realized that no one knows if there is an alternate season or not! Thanks my friends, your comments are very smart and funny =)",0.0311306340718105,

2025-05-26T20:45:01.441913+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs. Solana (SOL) is once again in the spotlight, as a market analyst has forecasted a massive rally that could propel the token’s price to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) by late 2025. The prediction suggests a staggering 140% surge from current levels toward a bold price target of $420 and beyond. Solana Prepares For Parabolic Move Toward $420 A fresh chart analysis shared by a TradingView crypto analyst, Master Ananda, reports that Solana has completed a textbook rounded bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal to new ATHs. Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target.  Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025. This pattern has now transitioned into a breakout structure, with the Solana price reportedly holding firm above the $160 support line — a level considered the baseline of the rounded bottom and a psychological stronghold for the market.  Notably, Solana faced a strong rejection at a key resistance area on May 23. However, despite the pullback, Master Ananda emphasized that the price action remains resilient, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact and the dip has not altered the altcoin’s positive long-term outlook in the months ahead.  In addition, Solana also dropped to a low on May 19, marked by the blue line on the price chart. Despite this, the analyst strongly asserts that there is “absolutely no bearish action” on the current chart.  As long as the $160 level holds, the current trend is likely to accelerate toward higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $419.78. This bullish target would represent approximately 140% growth from the current price of around $178 and would place Solana at a new all-time high.  Interestingly, Master Ananda noted that even if Solana falls below the key support level, it would be of little concern. Such a move would likely signal a market shakeout or a bear trap rather than a pullback or an invalidation of Solana’s bullish thesis. This view stems from the belief that SOL’s bullish bias has already been confirmed, positioning the market for potential strong growth over the long term.  The key point of Master Ananda’s analysis is that Solana’s rise is expected to be sudden and powerful, leaving those on the sidelines regretting missed opportunities. As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated.  Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly.

Solana (SOL) is once again in the spotlight, as a market analyst has forecasted a massive rally that could propel the token’s price to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) by late 2025. The prediction suggests a staggering 140% surge from current levels toward a bold price target of $420 and beyond. Solana Prepares For Parabolic Move Toward $420 A fresh chart analysis shared by a TradingView crypto analyst, Master Ananda, reports that Solana has completed a textbook rounded bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal to new ATHs. Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target.  Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025. This pattern has now transitioned into a breakout structure, with the Solana price reportedly holding firm above the $160 support line — a level considered the baseline of the rounded bottom and a psychological stronghold for the market.  Notably, Solana faced a strong rejection at a key resistance area on May 23. However, despite the pullback, Master Ananda emphasized that the price action remains resilient, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact and the dip has not altered the altcoin’s positive long-term outlook in the months ahead.  In addition, Solana also dropped to a low on May 19, marked by the blue line on the price chart. Despite this, the analyst strongly asserts that there is “absolutely no bearish action” on the current chart.  As long as the $160 level holds, the current trend is likely to accelerate toward higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $419.78. This bullish target would represent approximately 140% growth from the current price of around $178 and would place Solana at a new all-time high.  Interestingly, Master Ananda noted that even if Solana falls below the key support level, it would be of little concern. Such a move would likely signal a market shakeout or a bear trap rather than a pullback or an invalidation of Solana’s bullish thesis. This view stems from the belief that SOL’s bullish bias has already been confirmed, positioning the market for potential strong growth over the long term.  The key point of Master Ananda’s analysis is that Solana’s rise is expected to be sudden and powerful, leaving those on the sidelines regretting missed opportunities. As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated.  Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly. Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way The analyst suggests that Solana’s current price levels, while not at absolute lows, still represent a significant buy zone. Master Ananda revealed that Solana’s potential is substantial, and as the next bull cycle gains momentum, $300 will no longer be seen as expensive. Before this happens, Master Ananda has stated that investors “should be fully invested and buy like it’s the end of the world”.

2025-05-26T21:45:01.896445+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target.  Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025. This pattern has now transitioned into a breakout structure, with the Solana price reportedly holding firm above the $160 support line — a level considered the baseline of the rounded bottom and a psychological stronghold for the market.  Notably, Solana faced a strong rejection at a key resistance area on May 23. However, despite the pullback, Master Ananda emphasized that the price action remains resilient, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact and the dip has not altered the altcoin’s positive long-term outlook in the months ahead.  In addition, Solana also dropped to a low on May 19, marked by the blue line on the price chart. Despite this, the analyst strongly asserts that there is “absolutely no bearish action” on the current chart.  As long as the $160 level holds, the current trend is likely to accelerate toward higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $419.78. This bullish target would represent approximately 140% growth from the current price of around $178 and would place Solana at a new all-time high.  Interestingly, Master Ananda noted that even if Solana falls below the key support level, it would be of little concern. Such a move would likely signal a market shakeout or a bear trap rather than a pullback or an invalidation of Solana’s bullish thesis. This view stems from the belief that SOL’s bullish bias has already been confirmed, positioning the market for potential strong growth over the long term.  The key point of Master Ananda’s analysis is that Solana’s rise is expected to be sudden and powerful, leaving those on the sidelines regretting missed opportunities. As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated.  Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly. Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way The analyst suggests that Solana’s current price levels, while not at absolute lows, still represent a significant buy zone. Master Ananda revealed that Solana’s potential is substantial, and as the next bull cycle gains momentum, $300 will no longer be seen as expensive. Before this happens, Master Ananda has stated that investors “should be fully invested and buy like it’s the end of the world”.

2025-05-26T22:45:01.922222+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic. Dogecoin is losing altitude after a month-long advance that climaxed at an intraday high of $0.259 on May 11 before momentum cracked. The memecoin is changing hands near $0.228 today, capitalising the network at roughly $34 billion and leaving it 69$ below its 2021 peak. From a purely statistical angle, the retreat is modest: Dogecoin is still up about 35% from the early-May floor at $0.164, yet the pattern of lower highs that has emerged since mid-month has sharpened traders’ focus on whether the token’s April-to-May impulse was corrective rather than impulsive. Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? Technical analyst More Crypto Online argues in his latest YouTube briefing that the structure of this advance “rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” lacked the five-wave punch normally required to sustain upside continuation, and has already reversed into what looks like “a micro five-wave move down.” Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1 Is ‘Absolutely’ On The Table This Cycle, Says Analyst The Elliottician stated: “Doge rallied in three waves like many other crypto charts into the Friday swing high,” he told viewers at the top of the clip, stressing that the advance from the April 26 trough “was just not convincing.” The essence of his argument is that Dogecoin’s leap from $0.164 to the May 11 intraday peak at $0.259 never produced the five-wave structure that Elliott Wave theory associates with trend-sustaining moves. Instead, price action has already begun what he counts as a “micro five-wave move down,” thereby signalling that the April–May rise likely formed only the B-wave of a larger A-B-C correction. “As soon as the price breaks below the red dotted line at $0.21, the scenario for a larger pullback in the yellow count becomes confirmed,” he said, adding that nothing on the chart currently invalidates that view. The “yellow” scenario envisages an extended C-wave unfolding in five sub-waves and targeting the 38.2 %–78.6 % Fibonacci retracement cluster derived from the April rally. In plain numbers, that translates to $0.199–0.183 in the coming sessions. “Testing $0.19.9 to $0.183 cents over the coming sessions seems like quite a probable outcome,” More Crypto Online said. “We already have a five-wave decline from yesterday’s high, so we have to be ready for potentially just corrective rallies and then a sharp decline in wave three.” That roadmap leaves room for a brief recovery wave—he calls it wave 2 of C—to probe initial resistance at $0.23.3 to $0.24.7. Yet the analyst cautioned that any bounce should remain “only corrective” in character; a decisive hourly close above $0.247 cents would be needed to resurrect the bullish “orange” count, which allows for one final extension of the previous advance. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens “Any decisive break above $0.247 cents might mean we’re already in the extension to the upside,” he acknowledged, though he quickly added that such an outcome “would again be invalidated with a break below the dotted red line.” Macro context is doing Dogecoin no favours. With Treasury yields pushing toward new quarterly highs and Fitcoin dominance creeping up, liquidity has drained from high-beta altcoins. Even January’s debut of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, which helped funnel institutional money into the asset earlier this year, has not arrested the rotation out of fringe tokens during May’s risk-off stretch. From a market-structure standpoint, the token’s immediate fate boils down to whether bulls can defend the $0.21 pivot called out in the analysis. A daily close beneath that threshold would give bears license to press toward $0.19, while a break of the $0.247-cent barrier is the only development the analyst concedes could “reduce the potential for that decline.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228.

Solana (SOL) is once again in the spotlight, as a market analyst has forecasted a massive rally that could propel the token’s price to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) by late 2025. The prediction suggests a staggering 140% surge from current levels toward a bold price target of $420 and beyond. Solana Prepares For Parabolic Move Toward $420 A fresh chart analysis shared by a TradingView crypto analyst, Master Ananda, reports that Solana has completed a textbook rounded bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal to new ATHs. Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target.  Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025.

2025-05-27T00:45:01.270171+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs. Solana (SOL) is once again in the spotlight, as a market analyst has forecasted a massive rally that could propel the token’s price to new All-Time Highs (ATHs) by late 2025. The prediction suggests a staggering 140% surge from current levels toward a bold price target of $420 and beyond. Solana Prepares For Parabolic Move Toward $420 A fresh chart analysis shared by a TradingView crypto analyst, Master Ananda, reports that Solana has completed a textbook rounded bottom pattern, indicating a bullish reversal to new ATHs. Notably, the analyst forecasts that SOL is gearing up for a parabolic surge to $420, emphasizing that this bullish projection is not the cryptocurrency’s final target.  Related Reading: Analyst Tells Investors To Be Patient As Solana Price Hits Resistance The analysis, as stated earlier, is based on the formation of a rounded bottom pattern, which has been developing since early 2025. This pattern has now transitioned into a breakout structure, with the Solana price reportedly holding firm above the $160 support line — a level considered the baseline of the rounded bottom and a psychological stronghold for the market.  Notably, Solana faced a strong rejection at a key resistance area on May 23. However, despite the pullback, Master Ananda emphasized that the price action remains resilient, suggesting that bullish momentum is still intact and the dip has not altered the altcoin’s positive long-term outlook in the months ahead.  In addition, Solana also dropped to a low on May 19, marked by the blue line on the price chart. Despite this, the analyst strongly asserts that there is “absolutely no bearish action” on the current chart.  As long as the $160 level holds, the current trend is likely to accelerate toward higher Fibonacci resistance levels, culminating in the 1.618 extension at around $419.78. This bullish target would represent approximately 140% growth from the current price of around $178 and would place Solana at a new all-time high.  Interestingly, Master Ananda noted that even if Solana falls below the key support level, it would be of little concern. Such a move would likely signal a market shakeout or a bear trap rather than a pullback or an invalidation of Solana’s bullish thesis. This view stems from the belief that SOL’s bullish bias has already been confirmed, positioning the market for potential strong growth over the long term.  The key point of Master Ananda’s analysis is that Solana’s rise is expected to be sudden and powerful, leaving those on the sidelines regretting missed opportunities. As the market matures and liquidity improves following Bitcoin’s steady rise, the sharp upside potential for Solana could unfold much quicker than anticipated.  Macro Catalysts Align For Massive Crypto Growth While explaining his bullish case for Solana, Master Ananda revealed that changes in macroeconomic factors could become a catalyst for astonishing growth in the crypto market. With the US Federal Reserve (FED) expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming months, the broader risk-on environment is set to benefit the crypto sector significantly. Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way The analyst suggests that Solana’s current price levels, while not at absolute lows, still represent a significant buy zone. Master Ananda revealed that Solana’s potential is substantial, and as the next bull cycle gains momentum, $300 will no longer be seen as expensive. Before this happens, Master Ananda has stated that investors “should be fully invested and buy like it’s the end of the world”.

Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful &mdash; especially when it comes to cracking codes.</em></p><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/the-q-day-prize-challenge-explained-can-quantum-computers-really-break-bitcoin"">SHA-256 and ECDSA</a>. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They&rsquo;ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/public-key-vs-private-key"">your private key from your public address</a>, especially during that short window after you&rsquo;ve broadcast a transaction but before it&rsquo;s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.</p><p>That sounds dramatic, but it&rsquo;s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they&rsquo;re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn&rsquo;t there yet &mdash; not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin&rsquo;s cryptography.</p><p>Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"">BTC</a>) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/post-quantum-threats-to-proof-of-work-cryptocurrencies"">post-quantum cryptography</a>, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.</p><p><img alt=""Quantum computing vs classical computing"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/59f20f4e412668113e1c058de1013074.png"" title=""Quantum computing vs classical computing"" /></p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google&rsquo;s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.</em></p>                    </div><div id=""explained-block-193060-1"">            <h2>                Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.</em></p><h3>What Bitcoin&rsquo;s doing (and not doing yet)</h3><p>Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.</p><p>One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it&rsquo;s no small lift, but it&rsquo;s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called &ldquo;Q-Day&rdquo; sneaks up.</p><h3>Who&rsquo;s already ahead?</h3><p>Some blockchains aren&rsquo;t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-quantum-emergency-cryptography"">Falcon</a>, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that&rsquo;s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.</p><p><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-quantum-resistant-tokens-and-why-do-they-matter-for-crypto"">The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL)</a> is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It&rsquo;s not a major player in market cap terms, but it&rsquo;s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.</p><h3>Why it&rsquo;s not easy</h3><p>Of course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, switching everyone &mdash; miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users &mdash; to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it&rsquo;s planned years in advance.</p><p>Plus, there&rsquo;s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn&rsquo;t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you&rsquo;re exposed.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.</p>                    </div><div id=""explained-block-193060-0"">            <h2>                Bitcoin&rsquo;s future and quantum computing            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>If there&rsquo;s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it&rsquo;s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn&rsquo;t an option.</em></p><p>So, what does preparation look like?</p><p>For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren&rsquo;t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.</p><p>For crypto businesses &mdash; exchanges, custodians and wallet providers &mdash; the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what&rsquo;s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn&rsquo;t something the average holder can or should do alone.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s the regulatory side &mdash; maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.</p><p>You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what&rsquo;s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how and when this should happen.&rdquo;</p><p>Good policy here wouldn&rsquo;t mean clamping down on innovation &mdash; it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.</p><p>Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST&rsquo;s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.</p><h3>A slow burn&nbsp;</h3><p>BlackRock didn&rsquo;t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing &mdash; but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.</p><p>The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn&rsquo;t going to happen overnight. It&rsquo;ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.</p>                    </div></div>

2025-05-27T02:45:01.861450+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight?. Solana is trading at critical levels after weeks of strong price action and tight consolidation around current prices. Following an impressive 80% rally from its April lows, SOL is now testing a key horizontal resistance zone that could decide whether the uptrend continues or stalls in the short term. The recent consolidation has allowed the market to cool off while keeping the bullish structure intact—an encouraging sign for traders watching for a continuation move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis highlighting that Solana is now retesting a significant horizontal level that previously acted as resistance. A successful flip of this level into support could provide the momentum needed to push toward new local highs and potentially open the door to a full recovery rally. While overall market sentiment remains cautious amid broader macro uncertainty, Solana’s recent strength stands out among altcoins. Its ability to hold above key support during periods of volatility has positioned it as one of the better-performing assets in the current market cycle. If bulls maintain control and volume returns on the next breakout attempt, Solana could be gearing up for another leg higher in the days ahead. Solana Consolidates As Market Eyes Bullish Expansion Solana is currently consolidating just below a critical resistance level—the last major barrier before a potential breakout toward the weekly range highs. After gaining over 80% since its April lows, SOL is showing remarkable strength compared to most altcoins. However, the broader market remains on edge, as Bitcoin continues to trade just below its all-time highs, leaving investors uncertain about the potential for a correction. Despite this uncertainty, momentum across the crypto market suggests that the recent rally may be more than just a short-term bounce. Many analysts believe this could be the beginning of a larger bullish phase, one that carries significant upside if key resistance levels are cleared. Solana’s current consolidation is taking place directly under a major technical ceiling—if bulls can reclaim this zone, the path toward much higher prices opens quickly. Jelle echoed this view in a recent post, highlighting the importance of the $190 level. According to his analysis, “Above $190, all bets are off.” Reclaiming that resistance would likely confirm a breakout and shift sentiment decisively in favor of the bulls. It would also place Solana back on track to retest its all-time highs. For now, SOL is holding its ground while the market waits for Bitcoin’s next move. If BTC confirms strength and Solana breaks above $190, it could mark the beginning of a new wave of bullish price action, not just for SOL, but for the broader altcoin market as well. The coming days may be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Healthy – Data Shows No Signs Of Overheating Technical Details: Price Testing Key Moving Average Solana (SOL) is trading at $177.30, consolidating just below a key resistance level around $181, marked by the 200-day SMA. The daily chart shows that after a strong impulse rally from the April lows, SOL has entered a tight consolidation phase, forming a potential base for the next leg higher. The 34 EMA ($162.95), along with the 50 and 100 SMAs, are all trending upward and stacked in bullish alignment below the price, supporting the overall bullish structure. This indicates that the recent move is supported by strong trend momentum and healthy pullback dynamics. Volume has decreased slightly during the consolidation, which is typical during a pause before a potential breakout. However, the 200-day SMA continues to act as resistance, capping price advances multiple times over the last few days. A clean break and daily close above $181 could confirm the continuation of the uptrend and open the path toward the $200–$220 range, which aligns with the weekly range highs.

Holding above $170 and keeping pressure on $181 will be critical for bulls to maintain control. If BTC stabilizes or rallies, Solana could be one of the first major altcoins to break higher.

SOL price is now moving lower and might decline further below the $170 level. SOL price started a fresh decline from the $188 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $180 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $176 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $180 resistance zone. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price formed a base above the $170 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL gained pace for a move above the $172 and $175 resistance levels. The price tested the $188 resistance before there was a fresh drop to $170. A low was formed near $170 and the price recently attempted a fresh increase. The price cleared the $172 level. It surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $188 swing high to the $170 low. Solana is now trading below $180 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $176 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $176 level. The next major resistance is near the $180 level. The main resistance could be $185. A successful close above the $185 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $176 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $172 zone. The first major support is near the $170 level. A break below the $170 level might send the price toward the $165 zone and the trend line. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $160 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $172 and $170. Major Resistance Levels – $176 and $180.",0.0691666666666666,

2025-05-27T05:45:01.262718+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Incoming? $3 Target On The Horizon—Analyst. Dogecoin has held steady above $0.22 since May 20 and climbed back after a brief dip. It hit $0.25 on May 23, then eased into the weekend. In the last 24 hours, the token is up 4.1%. Over a week, it’s up 5%, even though it slipped midweek. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? The Triangle Pattern According to TradingView analyst Akbar Karimzsfeh, Dogecoin has been tracing a long, tightening triangle since its all-time high of $0.73536 on May 3, 2021. That peak was followed by a drop to $0.048 on June 13, 2022. Since then, every attempt to break lower—on June 5, August 14 and October 9 of 2023—has failed. The lines of the triangle are closing in. When they meet, a sharp move is likely. Key Resistance Levels Based on data, the upper trendline of the triangle also matches the top of a large “cup” pattern around $0.4916. There was an attempted breakout in December 2024, and prices almost hit that $0.4916 mark but got pushed back. After that, DOGE slid down to $0.13. It has since recovered some ground, but it still has to clear that $0.4916 hurdle before bulls can claim real control. Recent Price Moves Dogecoin hovered around $0.22 between May 20 and May 26. It peaked at $0.25 on May 23, only to slip afterward. Then the last 24-hour gain of 4.1% showed it can bounce from support. The 5% weekly rise points to steady buying, even with some pullbacks in the middle of the week. Traders are watching for a daily close above $0.50 as a sign that the long squeeze is over. On-Chain Metrics Rise On-chain data backs up the price action. New addresses have jumped by 102.40% in the past seven days. Active addresses climbed 111.32%. Zero balance addresses went up 155.45%. That suggests more people are sending small amounts of DOGE or testing the network. It doesn’t guarantee they’re holding long term, but it does flag higher interest and activity. DOGE price up in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive If Dogecoin can break above the top trendline and hold above $0.49, some see a move toward $3.08. That target is based on adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. It’s a big leap. Psychology and trading fees could slow that run. But the pattern says a strong move may be coming. Based on reports, caution is still wise. Wait for clear confirmation before betting on a moonshot. A slip below the lower trendline near $0.05 would turn the picture bearish. For now, Dogecoin sits in the balance, squeezed between two key trendlines. Traders and fans will be watching every close above $0.49 or fall below $0.05 to gauge the next big move.

ETH is now struggling and might drop again below the $2,500 support. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,500 and $2,520 levels. The price is trading near $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The pair could extend losses if there is a move below the $2,500 support zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price started a fresh increase from the $2,460 support zone, like Bitcoin. ETH price was able to recover above the $2,500 and $2,520 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,730 swing high to the $2,463 low. However, the bears were active near the $2,600 resistance zone. The price failed to clear $2,600 and reacted to the downside. Ethereum price is now trading near $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,555 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,580 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,600 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,730 swing high to the $2,463 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,650 level. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,720 resistance. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,850 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,520 zone. A clear move below the $2,520 support might push the price toward the $2,460 support.

Solana Price Dips Again Solana price formed a base above the $170 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL gained pace for a move above the $172 and $175 resistance levels. The price tested the $188 resistance before there was a fresh drop to $170. A low was formed near $170 and the price recently attempted a fresh increase. The price cleared the $172 level.

2025-05-27T06:45:09.305263+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Incoming? $3 Target On The Horizon—Analyst. Dogecoin has held steady above $0.22 since May 20 and climbed back after a brief dip. It hit $0.25 on May 23, then eased into the weekend. In the last 24 hours, the token is up 4.1%. Over a week, it’s up 5%, even though it slipped midweek. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? The Triangle Pattern According to TradingView analyst Akbar Karimzsfeh, Dogecoin has been tracing a long, tightening triangle since its all-time high of $0.73536 on May 3, 2021. That peak was followed by a drop to $0.048 on June 13, 2022. Since then, every attempt to break lower—on June 5, August 14 and October 9 of 2023—has failed. The lines of the triangle are closing in. When they meet, a sharp move is likely. Key Resistance Levels Based on data, the upper trendline of the triangle also matches the top of a large “cup” pattern around $0.4916. There was an attempted breakout in December 2024, and prices almost hit that $0.4916 mark but got pushed back. After that, DOGE slid down to $0.13. It has since recovered some ground, but it still has to clear that $0.4916 hurdle before bulls can claim real control. Recent Price Moves Dogecoin hovered around $0.22 between May 20 and May 26. It peaked at $0.25 on May 23, only to slip afterward. Then the last 24-hour gain of 4.1% showed it can bounce from support. The 5% weekly rise points to steady buying, even with some pullbacks in the middle of the week. Traders are watching for a daily close above $0.50 as a sign that the long squeeze is over. On-Chain Metrics Rise On-chain data backs up the price action. New addresses have jumped by 102.40% in the past seven days. Active addresses climbed 111.32%. Zero balance addresses went up 155.45%. That suggests more people are sending small amounts of DOGE or testing the network. It doesn’t guarantee they’re holding long term, but it does flag higher interest and activity. DOGE price up in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive If Dogecoin can break above the top trendline and hold above $0.49, some see a move toward $3.08. That target is based on adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. It’s a big leap. Psychology and trading fees could slow that run. But the pattern says a strong move may be coming. Based on reports, caution is still wise. Wait for clear confirmation before betting on a moonshot. A slip below the lower trendline near $0.05 would turn the picture bearish. For now, Dogecoin sits in the balance, squeezed between two key trendlines. Traders and fans will be watching every close above $0.49 or fall below $0.05 to gauge the next big move.

2025-05-27T07:45:01.244544+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

2025-05-27T08:45:01.766570+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Above $2,500: Here’s Why Analysts Think $3,000 May Be Next. Ethereum has maintained a position above $2,500 following a mild retracement from its recent high above $2,700 last week. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow. According to van de Poppe, such a breakout would signal the beginning of a new bullish phase for ETH. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",0.0659199134199134,

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

2025-05-27T09:45:01.261731+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Above $2,500: Here’s Why Analysts Think $3,000 May Be Next. Ethereum has maintained a position above $2,500 following a mild retracement from its recent high above $2,700 last week. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow. According to van de Poppe, such a breakout would signal the beginning of a new bullish phase for ETH. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",0.0659199134199134,
2025-05-27T09:45:01.261731+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,
2025-05-27T09:45:01.261731+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana (SOL) Flashes Bearish Signs — Are Further Losses Ahead?. Solana started a fresh decline from the $188 zone. SOL price is now moving lower and might decline further below the $170 level. SOL price started a fresh decline from the $188 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $180 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $176 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $180 resistance zone. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price formed a base above the $170 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL gained pace for a move above the $172 and $175 resistance levels. The price tested the $188 resistance before there was a fresh drop to $170. A low was formed near $170 and the price recently attempted a fresh increase. The price cleared the $172 level. It surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $188 swing high to the $170 low. Solana is now trading below $180 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $176 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $176 level. The next major resistance is near the $180 level. The main resistance could be $185. A successful close above the $185 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $176 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $172 zone. The first major support is near the $170 level. A break below the $170 level might send the price toward the $165 zone and the trend line. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $160 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $172 and $170. Major Resistance Levels – $176 and $180.",0.0691666666666666,
2025-05-27T09:45:01.261731+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Incoming? $3 Target On The Horizon—Analyst. Dogecoin has held steady above $0.22 since May 20 and climbed back after a brief dip. It hit $0.25 on May 23, then eased into the weekend. In the last 24 hours, the token is up 4.1%. Over a week, it’s up 5%, even though it slipped midweek. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? The Triangle Pattern According to TradingView analyst Akbar Karimzsfeh, Dogecoin has been tracing a long, tightening triangle since its all-time high of $0.73536 on May 3, 2021. That peak was followed by a drop to $0.048 on June 13, 2022. Since then, every attempt to break lower—on June 5, August 14 and October 9 of 2023—has failed. The lines of the triangle are closing in. When they meet, a sharp move is likely. Key Resistance Levels Based on data, the upper trendline of the triangle also matches the top of a large “cup” pattern around $0.4916. There was an attempted breakout in December 2024, and prices almost hit that $0.4916 mark but got pushed back. After that, DOGE slid down to $0.13. It has since recovered some ground, but it still has to clear that $0.4916 hurdle before bulls can claim real control. Recent Price Moves Dogecoin hovered around $0.22 between May 20 and May 26. It peaked at $0.25 on May 23, only to slip afterward. Then the last 24-hour gain of 4.1% showed it can bounce from support. The 5% weekly rise points to steady buying, even with some pullbacks in the middle of the week. Traders are watching for a daily close above $0.50 as a sign that the long squeeze is over. On-Chain Metrics Rise On-chain data backs up the price action. New addresses have jumped by 102.40% in the past seven days. Active addresses climbed 111.32%. Zero balance addresses went up 155.45%. That suggests more people are sending small amounts of DOGE or testing the network. It doesn’t guarantee they’re holding long term, but it does flag higher interest and activity. DOGE price up in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive If Dogecoin can break above the top trendline and hold above $0.49, some see a move toward $3.08. That target is based on adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. It’s a big leap. Psychology and trading fees could slow that run. But the pattern says a strong move may be coming. Based on reports, caution is still wise. Wait for clear confirmation before betting on a moonshot. A slip below the lower trendline near $0.05 would turn the picture bearish. For now, Dogecoin sits in the balance, squeezed between two key trendlines. Traders and fans will be watching every close above $0.49 or fall below $0.05 to gauge the next big move.

Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow. According to van de Poppe, such a breakout would signal the beginning of a new bullish phase for ETH. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",0.0659199134199134,
2025-05-27T10:45:01.855665+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,

The 5% weekly rise points to steady buying, even with some pullbacks in the middle of the week. Traders are watching for a daily close above $0.50 as a sign that the long squeeze is over. On-Chain Metrics Rise On-chain data backs up the price action. New addresses have jumped by 102.40% in the past seven days. Active addresses climbed 111.32%. Zero balance addresses went up 155.45%.

Ethereum has maintained a position above $2,500 following a mild retracement from its recent high above $2,700 last week. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-27T11:45:01.299787+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA.

2025-05-27T12:45:01.820237+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Above $2,500: Here’s Why Analysts Think $3,000 May Be Next. Ethereum has maintained a position above $2,500 following a mild retracement from its recent high above $2,700 last week. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow. According to van de Poppe, such a breakout would signal the beginning of a new bullish phase for ETH. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",0.0659199134199134,
2025-05-27T12:45:01.820237+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,
2025-05-27T12:45:01.820237+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA. However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0532072094572094,
2025-05-27T12:45:01.820237+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Incoming? $3 Target On The Horizon—Analyst. Dogecoin has held steady above $0.22 since May 20 and climbed back after a brief dip. It hit $0.25 on May 23, then eased into the weekend. In the last 24 hours, the token is up 4.1%. Over a week, it’s up 5%, even though it slipped midweek. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? The Triangle Pattern According to TradingView analyst Akbar Karimzsfeh, Dogecoin has been tracing a long, tightening triangle since its all-time high of $0.73536 on May 3, 2021. That peak was followed by a drop to $0.048 on June 13, 2022. Since then, every attempt to break lower—on June 5, August 14 and October 9 of 2023—has failed. The lines of the triangle are closing in. When they meet, a sharp move is likely. Key Resistance Levels Based on data, the upper trendline of the triangle also matches the top of a large “cup” pattern around $0.4916. There was an attempted breakout in December 2024, and prices almost hit that $0.4916 mark but got pushed back. After that, DOGE slid down to $0.13. It has since recovered some ground, but it still has to clear that $0.4916 hurdle before bulls can claim real control. Recent Price Moves Dogecoin hovered around $0.22 between May 20 and May 26. It peaked at $0.25 on May 23, only to slip afterward. Then the last 24-hour gain of 4.1% showed it can bounce from support. The 5% weekly rise points to steady buying, even with some pullbacks in the middle of the week. Traders are watching for a daily close above $0.50 as a sign that the long squeeze is over. On-Chain Metrics Rise On-chain data backs up the price action. New addresses have jumped by 102.40% in the past seven days. Active addresses climbed 111.32%. Zero balance addresses went up 155.45%. That suggests more people are sending small amounts of DOGE or testing the network. It doesn’t guarantee they’re holding long term, but it does flag higher interest and activity. DOGE price up in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive If Dogecoin can break above the top trendline and hold above $0.49, some see a move toward $3.08. That target is based on adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. It’s a big leap. Psychology and trading fees could slow that run. But the pattern says a strong move may be coming. Based on reports, caution is still wise. Wait for clear confirmation before betting on a moonshot. A slip below the lower trendline near $0.05 would turn the picture bearish. For now, Dogecoin sits in the balance, squeezed between two key trendlines. Traders and fans will be watching every close above $0.49 or fall below $0.05 to gauge the next big move.

According to this graph next dip should be in 2026.

If that dip drops -75% in 2026 that would mean, Bitcoin is expected to be cheaper in 2026 than it is today ($110,000) unless Bitcoin climbs above $440,000 by the end of this year.

This is highly speculative, trying to predict the market but if the cycle repeats these numbers are quite a food for thought if today in particular is a good day to stack those sats in favour of 2026.

Ethereum has maintained a position above $2,500 following a mild retracement from its recent high above $2,700 last week. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410.

According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow.

2025-05-27T13:45:01.277900+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,
2025-05-27T13:45:01.277900+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA. However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0532072094572094,
2025-05-27T13:45:01.277900+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Incoming? $3 Target On The Horizon—Analyst. Dogecoin has held steady above $0.22 since May 20 and climbed back after a brief dip. It hit $0.25 on May 23, then eased into the weekend. In the last 24 hours, the token is up 4.1%. Over a week, it’s up 5%, even though it slipped midweek. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip? The Triangle Pattern According to TradingView analyst Akbar Karimzsfeh, Dogecoin has been tracing a long, tightening triangle since its all-time high of $0.73536 on May 3, 2021. That peak was followed by a drop to $0.048 on June 13, 2022. Since then, every attempt to break lower—on June 5, August 14 and October 9 of 2023—has failed. The lines of the triangle are closing in. When they meet, a sharp move is likely. Key Resistance Levels Based on data, the upper trendline of the triangle also matches the top of a large “cup” pattern around $0.4916. There was an attempted breakout in December 2024, and prices almost hit that $0.4916 mark but got pushed back. After that, DOGE slid down to $0.13. It has since recovered some ground, but it still has to clear that $0.4916 hurdle before bulls can claim real control. Recent Price Moves Dogecoin hovered around $0.22 between May 20 and May 26. It peaked at $0.25 on May 23, only to slip afterward. Then the last 24-hour gain of 4.1% showed it can bounce from support. The 5% weekly rise points to steady buying, even with some pullbacks in the middle of the week. Traders are watching for a daily close above $0.50 as a sign that the long squeeze is over. On-Chain Metrics Rise On-chain data backs up the price action. New addresses have jumped by 102.40% in the past seven days. Active addresses climbed 111.32%. Zero balance addresses went up 155.45%. That suggests more people are sending small amounts of DOGE or testing the network. It doesn’t guarantee they’re holding long term, but it does flag higher interest and activity. DOGE price up in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2? Bold Call From Bybit Executive If Dogecoin can break above the top trendline and hold above $0.49, some see a move toward $3.08. That target is based on adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. It’s a big leap. Psychology and trading fees could slow that run. But the pattern says a strong move may be coming. Based on reports, caution is still wise. Wait for clear confirmation before betting on a moonshot. A slip below the lower trendline near $0.05 would turn the picture bearish. For now, Dogecoin sits in the balance, squeezed between two key trendlines. Traders and fans will be watching every close above $0.49 or fall below $0.05 to gauge the next big move.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

2025-05-27T16:45:01.276423+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Above $2,500: Here’s Why Analysts Think $3,000 May Be Next. Ethereum has maintained a position above $2,500 following a mild retracement from its recent high above $2,700 last week. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $2,564, reflecting a 2.4% increase in the past 24 hours. While the broader crypto market remains in a bullish structure, largely driven by Bitcoin’s sharp upward movement, Ethereum’s relative momentum appears more tempered, raising questions among traders and analysts about its current positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Finds Its Footing: Bulls Prepare for Another Push Retail Quiet, Institutions Watchful Despite the price remaining above key levels, some analysts believe Ethereum has yet to fully capture the broader market’s enthusiasm. One such observation was presented by CryptoQuant’s analyst Burak Kesmeci, who noted that retail activity around Ethereum remains low compared to previous cycles. This could suggest that Ethereum’s rally is still in its early stages, with potential upside left unpriced by the market. The absence of retail enthusiasm, which historically coincided with local tops, may signal that Ethereum has not yet reached a peak for this cycle. Kesmeci’s analysis highlighted a notable shift in retail engagement around Ethereum. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 bull run, the analyst pointed out that earlier rallies were often accompanied by sharp spikes in retail trading frequency. However, during the current cycle, retail interest has been largely muted, even as Bitcoin surged from $16,000 to over $111,000. While ETH saw a brief uptick in retail activity in December 2024, that momentum faded quickly amid broader market reactions to geopolitical developments, including renewed tariff tensions. The analyst concluded that the market may still be in a phase of accumulation, as the typical retail-driven euphoria has yet to materialize. In this scenario, Ethereum could benefit from increased participation in the coming months, particularly if macroeconomic sentiment stabilizes. The potential for delayed retail entry suggests that Ethereum’s current rally might only be at its midpoint rather than nearing a local top. Ethereum Technical Setups Suggest Bullish Continuation On the technical front, several market analysts continue to hold a positive outlook for ETH. A pseudonymous analyst known as Crypto Busy posted on X that the asset’s monthly chart remains structurally intact, referencing a previous key resistance level near $1,410. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? According to the post, Ethereum’s breakout above this long-standing barrier has turned it into support, replicating a setup that historically preceded major rallies. Further reinforcing this perspective, analyst Michaël van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s price action near the $2,400 level. He noted that this zone offered a strong buying opportunity and believes that if Ethereum can successfully retest and hold above this threshold, a move toward $3,000 could follow. According to van de Poppe, such a breakout would signal the beginning of a new bullish phase for ETH. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",0.0659199134199134,
2025-05-27T16:45:01.276423+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,
2025-05-27T16:45:01.276423+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA. However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0532072094572094,

Dogecoin slipped toward the lower end of its month-long range on Tuesday as independent chartist Quantum Ascent delivered a granular breakdown of why he believes the meme-coin is part-way through a corrective cascade that could end in the high-teen-cent zone.

Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm. Bitcoin — whose own fifth-wave top arrived sooner and overshot its prior cycle high — has already rolled into an ABC of its own, and Quantum Ascent expects altcoins to “settle down” alongside the bellwether. “Whether it goes quickly in a C-wave or we just kind of keep meandering, we’re going to have to wait and see,” he concluded, urging followers to watch volume profiles and closing levels rather than intraday wicks. As always, Elliott-wave counts remain interpretative rather than predictive, and traders should align any positioning with their personal risk limits.

2025-05-27T18:45:07.596167+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,
2025-05-27T18:45:07.596167+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA. However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0532072094572094,

But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive &mdash; and much more resilient &mdash; than that.</em></p><p><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-cryptocurrency-mining-still-profitable"">Bitcoin&rsquo;s mining</a> incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-explained"">nBits</a>. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.</p><p>So, if Bitcoin&rsquo;s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.</p><p>This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-bitcoin-miners-control-55-of-network"">banned mining in mid-2021</a>, Bitcoin&rsquo;s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.</p><p>Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power &mdash; even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower &mdash; miners will continue to secure the network.</p><p>In other words, it&rsquo;s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin&rsquo;s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.</p><p>Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-bitcoins-fee-to-reward-ratio"">fees</a>, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that&rsquo;s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system &mdash; <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-bitcoin-hash-rate-and-why-does-it-matter"">hashrate</a> adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt &mdash; remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin&rsquo;s design.<img alt=""Bitcoin emission rate vs time"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/9f3c73a642078ab98d0be8ce78e7c859.jpg"" title=""Bitcoin emission rate vs time"" /></p><p><br /><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin&rsquo;s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.</em></p>                    </div><div id=""explained-block-193306-0"">            <h2>                The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption            </h2>            <p>                </p><p><em>It&rsquo;s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use.

2025-05-27T19:03:05.210582+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,
2025-05-27T19:03:05.210582+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA. However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0532072094572094,
2025-05-27T19:03:05.210582+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone — Chartist Predicts Sharp Drop Ahead. Dogecoin slipped toward the lower end of its month-long range on Tuesday as independent chartist Quantum Ascent delivered a granular breakdown of why he believes the meme-coin is part-way through a corrective cascade that could end in the high-teen-cent zone. At mid-afternoon in Europe the token hovered at $0.228, nearly 12% below its May 11 peak and nursing modest intraday losses. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm. Bitcoin — whose own fifth-wave top arrived sooner and overshot its prior cycle high — has already rolled into an ABC of its own, and Quantum Ascent expects altcoins to “settle down” alongside the bellwether. “Whether it goes quickly in a C-wave or we just kind of keep meandering, we’re going to have to wait and see,” he concluded, urging followers to watch volume profiles and closing levels rather than intraday wicks. As always, Elliott-wave counts remain interpretative rather than predictive, and traders should align any positioning with their personal risk limits. Dogecoin retains the eighth-largest market capitalisation in crypto, but elevated volatility means even minor price gaps can translate into double-digit percentage swings. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0940873015873015,

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range.

Dogecoin slipped toward the lower end of its month-long range on Tuesday as independent chartist Quantum Ascent delivered a granular breakdown of why he believes the meme-coin is part-way through a corrective cascade that could end in the high-teen-cent zone. At mid-afternoon in Europe the token hovered at $0.228, nearly 12% below its May 11 peak and nursing modest intraday losses. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

2025-05-27T21:45:01.836429+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range. A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA. However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0532072094572094,
2025-05-27T21:45:01.836429+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone — Chartist Predicts Sharp Drop Ahead. Dogecoin slipped toward the lower end of its month-long range on Tuesday as independent chartist Quantum Ascent delivered a granular breakdown of why he believes the meme-coin is part-way through a corrective cascade that could end in the high-teen-cent zone. At mid-afternoon in Europe the token hovered at $0.228, nearly 12% below its May 11 peak and nursing modest intraday losses. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm. Bitcoin — whose own fifth-wave top arrived sooner and overshot its prior cycle high — has already rolled into an ABC of its own, and Quantum Ascent expects altcoins to “settle down” alongside the bellwether. “Whether it goes quickly in a C-wave or we just kind of keep meandering, we’re going to have to wait and see,” he concluded, urging followers to watch volume profiles and closing levels rather than intraday wicks. As always, Elliott-wave counts remain interpretative rather than predictive, and traders should align any positioning with their personal risk limits.

A successful breakout here could solidify Solana’s bullish structure and set the stage for a move toward $200 and beyond. However, risks remain. While Solana has outperformed most top assets in recent weeks, some analysts warn that the broader crypto market may be approaching a short-term correction. With Bitcoin consolidating near its all-time highs and macroeconomic conditions tightening, any downside pressure could drag altcoins—including Solana—lower before continuation. Adding to the uncertainty, Glassnode shared a notable data point showing that Solana is currently the only top 10 crypto asset (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. At -0.0002%, it’s a small shift, but one that may signal the early stages of bearish positioning among futures traders. Negative funding means that short sellers are paying to hold their positions, potentially indicating growing skepticism about short-term upside. This divergence between bullish spot performance and subtle bearish sentiment in derivatives could set up a high-stakes move. If bulls can absorb the pressure and flip resistance into support, Solana could enter a fresh price discovery phase. But if selling intensifies and funding remains negative, a deeper pullback may be on the horizon. For now, SOL is at a key decision point—and the next move could set the tone for the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Watch The $190 Level – ATHs Back In Sight? SOL Approaches Resistance As Weekly Structure Turns Bullish Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $175.68 on the weekly chart, consolidating just below the $180 resistance zone. After a strong rebound from April’s lows near $90, SOL has gained over 95% and is now approaching a critical level that has historically acted as a supply zone. The recent bullish momentum is notable, with three consecutive green weekly candles and price now trading above the 34-week EMA at $164.82—a level that previously capped upside attempts. The 50-week SMA at $169.48 has also been reclaimed, reinforcing the strength of the current move. Volume remains steady, suggesting buyer conviction is still intact as SOL pushes into this resistance zone. The next key test lies in whether bulls can break and close above the $180–$185 area, confirming a structural breakout and opening the door for a potential retest of the $200–$220 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Builds At $105K Level – Sweep Before New Highs? Failure to reclaim this zone could lead to short-term consolidation or a mild pullback toward the 34 EMA or 50 SMA. However, the current trend favors bulls, with higher lows and stronger weekly closes indicating sustained accumulation. If broader market conditions remain stable, Solana looks poised to attempt a breakout in the coming weeks. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0532072094572094,
2025-05-27T22:45:01.900283+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone — Chartist Predicts Sharp Drop Ahead. Dogecoin slipped toward the lower end of its month-long range on Tuesday as independent chartist Quantum Ascent delivered a granular breakdown of why he believes the meme-coin is part-way through a corrective cascade that could end in the high-teen-cent zone. At mid-afternoon in Europe the token hovered at $0.228, nearly 12% below its May 11 peak and nursing modest intraday losses. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm. Bitcoin — whose own fifth-wave top arrived sooner and overshot its prior cycle high — has already rolled into an ABC of its own, and Quantum Ascent expects altcoins to “settle down” alongside the bellwether. “Whether it goes quickly in a C-wave or we just kind of keep meandering, we’re going to have to wait and see,” he concluded, urging followers to watch volume profiles and closing levels rather than intraday wicks. As always, Elliott-wave counts remain interpretative rather than predictive, and traders should align any positioning with their personal risk limits. Dogecoin retains the eighth-largest market capitalisation in crypto, but elevated volatility means even minor price gaps can translate into double-digit percentage swings. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.228. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0940873015873015,

2025-05-27T23:45:01.296990+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,
2025-05-27T23:45:01.296990+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?. Solana is currently consolidating just below the $180 level after a strong rally, facing clear resistance as bulls attempt to maintain momentum. While the overall structure remains bullish, upward progress has stalled, and the market is entering a more cautious, tense phase. Buyers are still in control, but they’re struggling to push SOL decisively through this key barrier, keeping the price range-bound in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin UTXO Signal Approaches 99% Level – Bullish Signal Or Profit-Taking Setup? Adding to the intrigue, new data from Glassnode reveals that Solana is the only top 10 cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) with a negative funding rate. This could signal the early stages of short-side pressure building in the derivatives market. Negative funding suggests that traders are increasingly betting against the asset, even as spot price action holds relatively firm. This divergence between price consolidation and growing bearish positioning could act as a short-term catalyst if bulls regain momentum. Alternatively, it may hint at hesitation from traders who see limited upside in the immediate term. With sentiment on edge and key levels in play, Solana’s next move could set the tone for broader market behavior in the days ahead. Solana Faces Key Test After Rally Solana is at a critical inflection point after gaining more than 95% in value since April. The explosive rally has pushed SOL back to a major resistance zone, where previous supply has repeatedly capped upward momentum. Now, bulls must confirm the uptrend by pushing above this level and establishing a new higher range.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

Dogecoin slipped toward the lower end of its month-long range on Tuesday as independent chartist Quantum Ascent delivered a granular breakdown of why he believes the meme-coin is part-way through a corrective cascade that could end in the high-teen-cent zone. At mid-afternoon in Europe the token hovered at $0.228, nearly 12% below its May 11 peak and nursing modest intraday losses. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone Reviewing the daily chart, the analyst rewound to the explosive move that began on May 8 and produced a 50% three-session surge: “Last time we checked in over here on May 8, when we got this big green candle, we said, guys, looks like we’re kicking off our fifth microwave here,” he reminded viewers. His initial upside projection had been a modest 2.36 Fibonacci extension, yet Dogecoin “actually went up much higher,” a sign, he added, of strong retail momentum but also of a pattern that now looks finished. Quantum Ascent has since migrated his wave counts to show that the thrust was merely the fifth sub-wave inside a larger first-wave advance. “We’re in the middle of an ABC as we speak… these blue waves are going to move over to here,” he said, redrawing the labels to mark the ongoing retracement. In Elliott-wave parlance the C-leg must at least equal the A-leg, and the presenter converted that rule into arithmetic: “Eighteen-point-eight per cent from there… that’s one of our targets, right around 20.5 cents.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Chart Turns Ugly—This Price Could Trigger Panic Deeper penetration is not only possible but statistically common, he argued, because “oftentimes it makes it down into this third or fourth wave.” Measuring from the early-May low to the mid-May top, he plotted the 0.500, 0.618 and 0.702 retracements — a band stretching roughly from 19.5 cents to 17 cents — and called it “the logical zone for a first-and-second-wave reset.” A shallower halt at the 0.382, around 21.8 cents, would in his view be “a pretty shallow correction.” One attempt to break higher has already stalled in what he labelled the “danger zone” between the 0.618 and 0.786 retracements: “We took a stab to break through, but we didn’t close… we wicked above it, ended up right there at the 702, the rejection, and now it’s kind of rolling over again.” That failure leaves a nearby trigger level: “We break this low here at 21 cents, then we’re for sure seeing 20.5 cents.” The tape action, he added, resembles a Wyckoff re-accumulation structure: “Looks like honestly a form of Wyckoff and we’re building the sign of strength right here before we take off.” Yet the bullish pay-off, if it comes, likely lies several weeks ahead. The correction underway marks “a macro two that we’re working on right now,” he said, emphasising that the subsequent third wave would be decisive: “Macro wave threes — those are the daddies. Those are the big ones. That’s where we’re really going to get some juice.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Really Hit $3.80? Analyst Says Yes—If This Happens Macro context tempers any near-term enthusiasm. Bitcoin — whose own fifth-wave top arrived sooner and overshot its prior cycle high — has already rolled into an ABC of its own, and Quantum Ascent expects altcoins to “settle down” alongside the bellwether. “Whether it goes quickly in a C-wave or we just kind of keep meandering, we’re going to have to wait and see,” he concluded, urging followers to watch volume profiles and closing levels rather than intraday wicks.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

2025-05-28T03:45:01.327446+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"USDC or Lightning?

I’ve been following the rollout of **Steak n Shake’s new Bitcoin terminals** (which is wild, honestly) and noticed a pretty healthy debate on X (Twitter) about which cryptocurrency option will ultimately become the go-to for businesses—particularly small businesses.

On one hand, we’ve got the **Lightning Network**, a scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables faster, cheaper transactions. On the other hand, there are **stablecoins** like **USDC** (which major payment processors like **Stripe** and **Square Pay** have signaled support for). This begs the question: **if you’re a small business owner, which option makes more sense?**



Here’s the debate as I see it at this point:

**⚡ Lightning Network**

* Pros: Near-instant transactions with super low fees (we’re talking fractions of a cent). It’s directly tied to Bitcoin, which could attract die-hard BTC enthusiasts. Also, there’s the narrative that “Bitcoin is sound money,” and some people genuinely prefer paying in BTC.
* Cons: Lightning is still somewhat niche with specific wallets needed. The user experience for both merchants and customers can be clunky compared to traditional credit card systems. There’s also the price volatility of Bitcoin itself, which can be a headache for businesses trying to manage cash flow.

**💵 Stablecoins (like USDC)**

* Pros: Stablecoins offer price stability (1 USDC = $1), which businesses love. Plus, big processors like Stripe and Square Pay are making it easier to integrate USDC into existing systems. For customers, paying with a dollar-pegged coin feels more intuitive and less risky than paying with Bitcoin.
* Cons: Depending on how payments are handled, there might still be crypto-specific complexity. Also, stablecoins are only as stable as the regulations and companies backing them. USDC, for example, has been through some ups and downs with market perception.



**Why does this matter?**

For small businesses—think your local coffee shop, indie retailer, or service provider—the decision of which crypto payment option to integrate isn’t just about technical features. It’s about **ease of use**, **customer demand**, **fees**, **regulatory compliance**, and the potential **future-proofing** of their payment systems.

As far as I can tell, both **Stripe** and **Square** are moving toward supporting **both Lightning and stablecoins**, so merchants might not have to choose one or the other eventually. But for now, adoption on the Lightning side seems slower outside of Bitcoin-heavy communities, whereas **USDC and other stablecoins are gaining more traction with mainstream payment platforms**.

Personally, I think we’ll see small businesses favor stablecoins in the short term, since they’re more aligned with how people already think about money. **Lightning might become more appealing as the technology matures and the Bitcoin narrative continues to gain traction.**

I’m curious what the /cryptocurrency community thinks. **If you ran a small business and had to choose between accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments or stablecoins like USDC, which would you pick and why?** Are there other options I should be considering?



Also, if anyone has experience using either in a real-world business, I’d love to hear about your experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

2025-05-28T05:45:01.253289+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"USDC or Lightning?

I’ve been following the rollout of **Steak n Shake’s new Bitcoin terminals** (which is wild, honestly) and noticed a pretty healthy debate on X (Twitter) about which cryptocurrency option will ultimately become the go-to for businesses—particularly small businesses.

On one hand, we’ve got the **Lightning Network**, a scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables faster, cheaper transactions. On the other hand, there are **stablecoins** like **USDC** (which major payment processors like **Stripe** and **Square Pay** have signaled support for). This begs the question: **if you’re a small business owner, which option makes more sense?**



Here’s the debate as I see it at this point:

**⚡ Lightning Network**

* Pros: Near-instant transactions with super low fees (we’re talking fractions of a cent). It’s directly tied to Bitcoin, which could attract die-hard BTC enthusiasts. Also, there’s the narrative that “Bitcoin is sound money,” and some people genuinely prefer paying in BTC.
* Cons: Lightning is still somewhat niche with specific wallets needed. The user experience for both merchants and customers can be clunky compared to traditional credit card systems. There’s also the price volatility of Bitcoin itself, which can be a headache for businesses trying to manage cash flow.

**💵 Stablecoins (like USDC)**

* Pros: Stablecoins offer price stability (1 USDC = $1), which businesses love. Plus, big processors like Stripe and Square Pay are making it easier to integrate USDC into existing systems. For customers, paying with a dollar-pegged coin feels more intuitive and less risky than paying with Bitcoin.
* Cons: Depending on how payments are handled, there might still be crypto-specific complexity. Also, stablecoins are only as stable as the regulations and companies backing them. USDC, for example, has been through some ups and downs with market perception.



**Why does this matter?**

For small businesses—think your local coffee shop, indie retailer, or service provider—the decision of which crypto payment option to integrate isn’t just about technical features. It’s about **ease of use**, **customer demand**, **fees**, **regulatory compliance**, and the potential **future-proofing** of their payment systems.

As far as I can tell, both **Stripe** and **Square** are moving toward supporting **both Lightning and stablecoins**, so merchants might not have to choose one or the other eventually. But for now, adoption on the Lightning side seems slower outside of Bitcoin-heavy communities, whereas **USDC and other stablecoins are gaining more traction with mainstream payment platforms**.

Personally, I think we’ll see small businesses favor stablecoins in the short term, since they’re more aligned with how people already think about money. **Lightning might become more appealing as the technology matures and the Bitcoin narrative continues to gain traction.**

I’m curious what the /cryptocurrency community thinks. **If you ran a small business and had to choose between accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments or stablecoins like USDC, which would you pick and why?** Are there other options I should be considering?



Also, if anyone has experience using either in a real-world business, I’d love to hear about your experience.

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

2025-05-28T06:45:01.756741+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

2025-05-28T07:45:01.234474+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns. On-chain data shows a large portion of the Ethereum market cap was acquired near the current price, making ETH&#8217;s position potentially fragile. $123 Billion In Ethereum Market Cap Sits Close To Cost Basis As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently above the spot price by just 0 to 20%. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Market Cap by Profit and Loss,&#8221; which tells us about how much of the ETH market cap has its cost basis sitting within what distance of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Formally, the market cap is defined as the total circulating supply of the asset multiplied by the latest spot value. As such, the market cap of a particular group of tokens would be just their number multiplied by the price. The Market Cap by Profit and Loss refers to the last transaction price of these coins to determine whether the market cap held by them is in profit or loss right now. Naturally, the cost basis of the tokens being under the latest price suggests they are in profit, while the opposite case puts them in the loss category. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value for Ethereum over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently contained within the 0 to 20% cohort. This group includes coins that currently have their value between 0 and 20% above their cost basis. Naturally, even the tokens on the higher end of the range wouldn&#8217;t be in that big a profit at the moment. In total, about $123 billion of the ETH market cap, equivalent to almost 38%, falls under this category. Considering the delicate profit-loss balance that all this supply has, it&#8217;s possible that even an ordinary pullback could send a large number of tokens underwater. &#8220;Despite recent gains, ETH remains in a fragile position,&#8221; notes Glassnode. In some other news, Ethereum has witnessed a buying push from the whales during the past month, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. &#8220;Whales&#8221; are defined as the investors carrying between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the total Ethereum supply held by this cohort has registered a notable increase in the last few weeks.

More specifically, the whales have added around 1 million ETH (worth around $2.7 billion at the current exchange rate) to their holdings in this period. ETH Price Ethereum observed a decline below the $2,500 level earlier, but it seems the coin has found a rebound as it&#8217;s back at $2,700.

2025-05-28T07:45:01.234474+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Web3 will replace Web2. Here are the 3 branches from my past work experience.

I've been working in Web3 for the past 5 years, across products, protocols, and infra, and the pattern is clear: Web3 is substituting Web2, quietly, structurally,.

1. 🕹️ Games, the inevitable fully on-chain migration (Unpopular Opinion)

Most people still think Web3 gaming is just NFTs and marketplace skins. That’s already outdated.

The real shift is **fully on-chain games**, where the *entire* game logic (not just assets) lives on a public, composable, unstoppable execution layer.

Why does this matter?

* Ownership isn’t just of assets, but of game logic.
* Modding becomes composable.
* Verifiability matters. Tournaments, PvP, outcomes, all provable. This means no cheating, no admin abuse. Which is the ultimate benefit.
* New genres emerge. Think on-chain MMOs, prediction arenas, or real-time esports that run trustlessly.

Where do I see the actual buzz? It's defintely behind Solana and Magicblock. Unpopular again cuz most would expect starknet, but DYOR and u'll understand why its SVM and not EVM.

🕒 **Timeline**? 5–10–15 years. It'll look like a niche forever, until suddenly it doesn’t.

# 2. 🪪 Digital Identities

Web2 IDs are controlled by Google, Apple, Meta. They're siloed, opaque, and fundamentally extractive.

Web3 offers something different: **zero-knowledge credentials + decentralized identifiers**.

Why is this powerful?

* **Selective disclosure:** Prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthdate.
* **Portability:** Use your reputation, access, and credentials across apps, chains, and platforms.
* **Privacy-first by design:** Data isn't collected—it's self-issued or selectively revealed.
* **No middlemen:** No email/password resets, no forgotten logins, no 3rd party OAuth.

VCs + ZKPs are maturing *fast*. We’re already seeing traction in DAO governance, DePIN attestations, and social networks.

🕒 **Timeline**? Already happening. Will go mainstream in 3–5 years. What I mean by mainstream is, you will have you identity digital, passport digital.

# 3. 📡 DePIN, the invisible takeover of physical infrastructure

DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure) might be the most underappreciated pillar of Web3.

It’s the idea that physical networks—WiFi, sensors, storage, satellites, compute—can be bootstrapped, owned, and governed by the people who use them.

Why is this a big deal?

* **Incentive-aligned growth:** People deploy infrastructure because they’re rewarded fairly.
* **Unstoppable coverage:** Projects like Helium, DIMO, and others are building bottom-up networks where telcos or cloud providers won’t.
* **Composability + data markets:** All this data becomes public, queryable, and monetizable without silos.

Think Waze, but where every user gets paid. Think AWS, but owned by the devs. Think Uber routing, but with encrypted, trustless GPS data.

🕒 **Timeline**? Early innings. Next 5 years will define winners.",0.0258701883701883,

Following a notable performance over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a key level as support. Some analysts suggest a breakout toward the $3,000 mark could be coming if the $2,600 mark holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst Ethereum Prepares For Massive Breakout On Tuesday, Ethereum surged to the $2,700 resistance after a 6.3% price jump in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency climbed from the $2,500 support zone toward the recent resistance level, hitting the $2,712 mark before retracing. ETH has been unable to cross this zone after recording its three-month high of $2,738 two weeks ago, halting its retest of higher horizontal levels. Notably, the King of Altcoins has surged over 50% in the past month and around 98% from April’s lows. Amid the May crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of $111,953 last week, Ethereum has traded sideways for most of the month, hovering between the $2,450-$2,600 price range. Nonetheless, ETH has outperformed Bitcoin so far during the second quarter, registering a 47.78% increase since April started. Analyst The Cryptonomist pointed out that Ethereum has broken above the $2,600 level, signaling that a reclaim of this level could conclude ETH’s sideways action between its current price range and propel its price toward the $3,400 mark. Similarly, Crypto Bullet affirmed that ETH is “about to break out and fill the big CME Gap.” According to the chart, the Altcoin appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle over the past few weeks, and is currently attempting to break out from the formation. A successful breakout and retest of the $2,700 level could send ETH’s price to the CME GAP levels, between $2,900 and $3,350, which other analysts also believe will be filled soon. ETH Dominance To Surge In June? Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum Dominance is “showcasing initial signs of trying to hold the ~9% level as support,” suggesting a potential bullish performance in June. As the analyst explained, ETH dominance has bounced since dropping to new All-Time Lows (ATL) last month, playing out “the full extent of its September 2019 upside.” Keeping this level as support could propel the cryptocurrency to a more market-dominant performance next month, resembling its 2019 playbook. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move Market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum’s chart “is screaming bullish,” showing a multi-year base and “clean” bullish pennant pattern. To the trader, this setup could launch the cryptocurrency to a long-term target of $8,000 after breaking above the $3,000 mark. Additionally, ETH is preparing for the cycle’s “final pump,” according to Merlijn, based on its previous performances. He pointed out that Ethereum “goes vertical” after breaking its previous high every cycle. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,686, an 8.8% increase in the weekly timeframe.

On-chain data shows a large portion of the Ethereum market cap was acquired near the current price, making ETH&#8217;s position potentially fragile. $123 Billion In Ethereum Market Cap Sits Close To Cost Basis As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently above the spot price by just 0 to 20%. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Market Cap by Profit and Loss,&#8221; which tells us about how much of the ETH market cap has its cost basis sitting within what distance of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Formally, the market cap is defined as the total circulating supply of the asset multiplied by the latest spot value. As such, the market cap of a particular group of tokens would be just their number multiplied by the price. The Market Cap by Profit and Loss refers to the last transaction price of these coins to determine whether the market cap held by them is in profit or loss right now. Naturally, the cost basis of the tokens being under the latest price suggests they are in profit, while the opposite case puts them in the loss category. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value for Ethereum over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently contained within the 0 to 20% cohort. This group includes coins that currently have their value between 0 and 20% above their cost basis. Naturally, even the tokens on the higher end of the range wouldn&#8217;t be in that big a profit at the moment. In total, about $123 billion of the ETH market cap, equivalent to almost 38%, falls under this category. Considering the delicate profit-loss balance that all this supply has, it&#8217;s possible that even an ordinary pullback could send a large number of tokens underwater. &#8220;Despite recent gains, ETH remains in a fragile position,&#8221; notes Glassnode. In some other news, Ethereum has witnessed a buying push from the whales during the past month, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. &#8220;Whales&#8221; are defined as the investors carrying between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the total Ethereum supply held by this cohort has registered a notable increase in the last few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? More specifically, the whales have added around 1 million ETH (worth around $2.7 billion at the current exchange rate) to their holdings in this period.

If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2350 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.220 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.2150 level. The main support sits at $0.2120. If there is a downside break below the $0.2120 support, the price could decline further.

On-chain data shows a large portion of the Ethereum market cap was acquired near the current price, making ETH&#8217;s position potentially fragile. $123 Billion In Ethereum Market Cap Sits Close To Cost Basis As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently above the spot price by just 0 to 20%. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Market Cap by Profit and Loss,&#8221; which tells us about how much of the ETH market cap has its cost basis sitting within what distance of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Formally, the market cap is defined as the total circulating supply of the asset multiplied by the latest spot value. As such, the market cap of a particular group of tokens would be just their number multiplied by the price. The Market Cap by Profit and Loss refers to the last transaction price of these coins to determine whether the market cap held by them is in profit or loss right now. Naturally, the cost basis of the tokens being under the latest price suggests they are in profit, while the opposite case puts them in the loss category. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value for Ethereum over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently contained within the 0 to 20% cohort. This group includes coins that currently have their value between 0 and 20% above their cost basis. Naturally, even the tokens on the higher end of the range wouldn&#8217;t be in that big a profit at the moment. In total, about $123 billion of the ETH market cap, equivalent to almost 38%, falls under this category. Considering the delicate profit-loss balance that all this supply has, it&#8217;s possible that even an ordinary pullback could send a large number of tokens underwater. &#8220;Despite recent gains, ETH remains in a fragile position,&#8221; notes Glassnode. In some other news, Ethereum has witnessed a buying push from the whales during the past month, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. &#8220;Whales&#8221; are defined as the investors carrying between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the total Ethereum supply held by this cohort has registered a notable increase in the last few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next?

On-chain data shows a large portion of the Ethereum market cap was acquired near the current price, making ETH&#8217;s position potentially fragile. $123 Billion In Ethereum Market Cap Sits Close To Cost Basis As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently above the spot price by just 0 to 20%. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Market Cap by Profit and Loss,&#8221; which tells us about how much of the ETH market cap has its cost basis sitting within what distance of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Formally, the market cap is defined as the total circulating supply of the asset multiplied by the latest spot value. As such, the market cap of a particular group of tokens would be just their number multiplied by the price. The Market Cap by Profit and Loss refers to the last transaction price of these coins to determine whether the market cap held by them is in profit or loss right now. Naturally, the cost basis of the tokens being under the latest price suggests they are in profit, while the opposite case puts them in the loss category. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value for Ethereum over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently contained within the 0 to 20% cohort. This group includes coins that currently have their value between 0 and 20% above their cost basis. Naturally, even the tokens on the higher end of the range wouldn&#8217;t be in that big a profit at the moment. In total, about $123 billion of the ETH market cap, equivalent to almost 38%, falls under this category. Considering the delicate profit-loss balance that all this supply has, it&#8217;s possible that even an ordinary pullback could send a large number of tokens underwater. &#8220;Despite recent gains, ETH remains in a fragile position,&#8221; notes Glassnode. In some other news, Ethereum has witnessed a buying push from the whales during the past month, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. &#8220;Whales&#8221; are defined as the investors carrying between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the total Ethereum supply held by this cohort has registered a notable increase in the last few weeks.

Dogecoin has yet to hit its previous $0.74 all-time high from 2021, but nevertheless, $1 has remained the target for the altcoin this cycle. This is due to the expectation of another altcoin season that could send the price on a similar run that was seen in 2021. However, if the Dogecoin price were to actually see a repeat of what happened in the past two previous bull cycles, then the $1 mark may only be a starting point, given how high the price could go. Dogecoin Price Mirroring Past Cycles Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has noticed an eerily similar pattern on the Dogecoin price chart that could suggest a rapid upward movement is coming. This pattern is similar to what was seen in the last two bullish cycles, right as the meme coin’s price was preparing for lift-off. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out As the chart shows, this pattern first emerged leading up to the bullish rally in 2017. It starts out a couple of years before as the altcoin’s price makes lower peaks and then trends down for a retest. After this, there is a period of consolidation before the trend is broken and an upward rally begins. In the 2017-2018 bull market, this pattern saw the Dogecoin price rally by more than 2,000%, going from below $0.00018 to above $0.0075 in a matter of months. Then again, in the 2020-2021 bull market, a similar pattern had formed right before the rally, ending in a breakout from consolidation. Interestingly, this time around, the resulting breakout was even more prominent, with the meme coin’s price rising by more than 30,000%. This saw a range from below $0.002 to above $0.73 in a matter of months. This is still the highest level that the Dogecoin price has reached so far. Once again, a similar pattern has emerged, and it looks like Dogecoin is on the brink of the next breakout. Going by the previous cycle performances and the steady uptrend, it is possible that the current breakout will see a higher ROI than previous cycles. But, there are now market cap constraints on how high the meme coin can go. Related Reading: Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue Nevertheless, even if the Dogecoin price were to manage a similar rise like the 2017-2018 cycle, the price would reach $4 minimum from here. Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, though, he expects the Dogecoin price to actually cross the double-digit threshold, putting it as high as $12. However, given Dogecoin’s high supply sitting above 149 billion coins, the possibilities of this happening this cycle are very slim. A $12 price tag would put the meme coin at a market cap above 1.7 trillion, something that even Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has yet to achieve.

This statue was funded by Ripple to discredit Bitcoin. Greenpeace had this beauty made after receiving funding from Ripple do bash Bitcoin.

That’s the thing you lot are investing in - this is not an opinion but a fact. Give it a thought, why does Ripple do this? Why does it think it needs to do this? Is this the place you want to put your money on?

Free world, free choice.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. It’s on display at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas at the moment.

So this was what they removed, which says a lot about the people involved.

Honestly, how are people still buying the XRP dream in 2025? Ripple has been dumping on retail for years and somehow folks still act like it’s the next big thing. The Ripple foundation (or whatever they call themselves now) keeps unlocking billions of XRP from escrow and selling it straight into the market. Like clockwork. Retail gets excited about some vague announcement, and boom — here comes the dump. Every. Single. Time.

And can we talk about use case for a second? Who is actually using RippleNet? Like, seriously. Go ahead, I’ll wait. There’s no real volume. No big adoption. Just partnerships that sound impressive on paper and end up being “pilots” that go nowhere. It’s all smoke. And mirrors. And more smoke.

Meanwhile, the banks Ripple was supposed to “disrupt” have made it clear they want stablecoins. Not XRP. Not volatile tokens that dump 30% on a Tuesday because the market hiccupped. They want compliance-friendly, fiat-pegged coins they can actually use without scaring off regulators. USDC, USDT, maybe a CBDC or two — not your grandma’s XRP bag.

And yes, let’s not forget the lawsuits and the regulatory “clarity” that’s always juuuust around the corner. Same story since like 2018. At this point it’s just hopium. XRP isn’t a revolution, it’s a nostalgia project. Like MySpace for blockchain. Except MySpace had actual users.

The community’s down bad but still talking like it’s 2017 moon season. Wake up. Ripple isn’t taking over the banking world — it’s taking your liquidity and thanking you for the exit liquidity.

2025-05-28T15:45:02.081141+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns. On-chain data shows a large portion of the Ethereum market cap was acquired near the current price, making ETH&#8217;s position potentially fragile. $123 Billion In Ethereum Market Cap Sits Close To Cost Basis As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently above the spot price by just 0 to 20%. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;Market Cap by Profit and Loss,&#8221; which tells us about how much of the ETH market cap has its cost basis sitting within what distance of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Formally, the market cap is defined as the total circulating supply of the asset multiplied by the latest spot value. As such, the market cap of a particular group of tokens would be just their number multiplied by the price. The Market Cap by Profit and Loss refers to the last transaction price of these coins to determine whether the market cap held by them is in profit or loss right now. Naturally, the cost basis of the tokens being under the latest price suggests they are in profit, while the opposite case puts them in the loss category. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value for Ethereum over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently contained within the 0 to 20% cohort. This group includes coins that currently have their value between 0 and 20% above their cost basis. Naturally, even the tokens on the higher end of the range wouldn&#8217;t be in that big a profit at the moment. In total, about $123 billion of the ETH market cap, equivalent to almost 38%, falls under this category. Considering the delicate profit-loss balance that all this supply has, it&#8217;s possible that even an ordinary pullback could send a large number of tokens underwater. &#8220;Despite recent gains, ETH remains in a fragile position,&#8221; notes Glassnode. In some other news, Ethereum has witnessed a buying push from the whales during the past month, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. &#8220;Whales&#8221; are defined as the investors carrying between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the total Ethereum supply held by this cohort has registered a notable increase in the last few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? More specifically, the whales have added around 1 million ETH (worth around $2.7 billion at the current exchange rate) to their holdings in this period.

2025-05-28T15:45:02.081141+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself. Dogecoin has yet to hit its previous $0.74 all-time high from 2021, but nevertheless, $1 has remained the target for the altcoin this cycle. This is due to the expectation of another altcoin season that could send the price on a similar run that was seen in 2021. However, if the Dogecoin price were to actually see a repeat of what happened in the past two previous bull cycles, then the $1 mark may only be a starting point, given how high the price could go. Dogecoin Price Mirroring Past Cycles Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has noticed an eerily similar pattern on the Dogecoin price chart that could suggest a rapid upward movement is coming. This pattern is similar to what was seen in the last two bullish cycles, right as the meme coin’s price was preparing for lift-off. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out As the chart shows, this pattern first emerged leading up to the bullish rally in 2017. It starts out a couple of years before as the altcoin’s price makes lower peaks and then trends down for a retest. After this, there is a period of consolidation before the trend is broken and an upward rally begins. In the 2017-2018 bull market, this pattern saw the Dogecoin price rally by more than 2,000%, going from below $0.00018 to above $0.0075 in a matter of months. Then again, in the 2020-2021 bull market, a similar pattern had formed right before the rally, ending in a breakout from consolidation. Interestingly, this time around, the resulting breakout was even more prominent, with the meme coin’s price rising by more than 30,000%. This saw a range from below $0.002 to above $0.73 in a matter of months. This is still the highest level that the Dogecoin price has reached so far. Once again, a similar pattern has emerged, and it looks like Dogecoin is on the brink of the next breakout. Going by the previous cycle performances and the steady uptrend, it is possible that the current breakout will see a higher ROI than previous cycles. But, there are now market cap constraints on how high the meme coin can go. Related Reading: Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue Nevertheless, even if the Dogecoin price were to manage a similar rise like the 2017-2018 cycle, the price would reach $4 minimum from here. Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, though, he expects the Dogecoin price to actually cross the double-digit threshold, putting it as high as $12. However, given Dogecoin’s high supply sitting above 149 billion coins, the possibilities of this happening this cycle are very slim. A $12 price tag would put the meme coin at a market cap above 1.7 trillion, something that even Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has yet to achieve.

2025-05-28T16:45:01.406053+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"XRP reddit removed this post:

This statue was funded by Ripple to discredit Bitcoin. Greenpeace had this beauty made after receiving funding from Ripple do bash Bitcoin.

That’s the thing you lot are investing in - this is not an opinion but a fact. Give it a thought, why does Ripple do this? Why does it think it needs to do this? Is this the place you want to put your money on?

Free world, free choice.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. It’s on display at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas at the moment.

So this was what they removed, which says a lot about the people involved.

Honestly, how are people still buying the XRP dream in 2025? Ripple has been dumping on retail for years and somehow folks still act like it’s the next big thing. The Ripple foundation (or whatever they call themselves now) keeps unlocking billions of XRP from escrow and selling it straight into the market. Like clockwork. Retail gets excited about some vague announcement, and boom — here comes the dump. Every. Single. Time.

And can we talk about use case for a second? Who is actually using RippleNet? Like, seriously. Go ahead, I’ll wait. There’s no real volume. No big adoption. Just partnerships that sound impressive on paper and end up being “pilots” that go nowhere. It’s all smoke. And mirrors. And more smoke.

Meanwhile, the banks Ripple was supposed to “disrupt” have made it clear they want stablecoins. Not XRP. Not volatile tokens that dump 30% on a Tuesday because the market hiccupped. They want compliance-friendly, fiat-pegged coins they can actually use without scaring off regulators. USDC, USDT, maybe a CBDC or two — not your grandma’s XRP bag.

And yes, let’s not forget the lawsuits and the regulatory “clarity” that’s always juuuust around the corner. Same story since like 2018. At this point it’s just hopium. XRP isn’t a revolution, it’s a nostalgia project. Like MySpace for blockchain. Except MySpace had actual users.

The community’s down bad but still talking like it’s 2017 moon season. Wake up. Ripple isn’t taking over the banking world — it’s taking your liquidity and thanking you for the exit liquidity.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. Thanks for reading my rant and hope to see you on team bitcoin, to make an actual positive impact for our world and not just for the banks.

In the 2017-2018 bull market, this pattern saw the Dogecoin price rally by more than 2,000%, going from below $0.00018 to above $0.0075 in a matter of months. Then again, in the 2020-2021 bull market, a similar pattern had formed right before the rally, ending in a breakout from consolidation. Interestingly, this time around, the resulting breakout was even more prominent, with the meme coin’s price rising by more than 30,000%. This saw a range from below $0.002 to above $0.73 in a matter of months. This is still the highest level that the Dogecoin price has reached so far. Once again, a similar pattern has emerged, and it looks like Dogecoin is on the brink of the next breakout. Going by the previous cycle performances and the steady uptrend, it is possible that the current breakout will see a higher ROI than previous cycles. But, there are now market cap constraints on how high the meme coin can go. Related Reading: Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue Nevertheless, even if the Dogecoin price were to manage a similar rise like the 2017-2018 cycle, the price would reach $4 minimum from here. Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, though, he expects the Dogecoin price to actually cross the double-digit threshold, putting it as high as $12. However, given Dogecoin’s high supply sitting above 149 billion coins, the possibilities of this happening this cycle are very slim. A $12 price tag would put the meme coin at a market cap above 1.7 trillion, something that even Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has yet to achieve.

2025-05-28T17:45:08.396704+00:00,Bitcoin,Reddit,"XRP reddit removed this post:

This statue was funded by Ripple to discredit Bitcoin. Greenpeace had this beauty made after receiving funding from Ripple do bash Bitcoin.

That’s the thing you lot are investing in - this is not an opinion but a fact. Give it a thought, why does Ripple do this? Why does it think it needs to do this? Is this the place you want to put your money on?

Free world, free choice.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. It’s on display at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas at the moment.

So this was what they removed, which says a lot about the people involved.

Honestly, how are people still buying the XRP dream in 2025? Ripple has been dumping on retail for years and somehow folks still act like it’s the next big thing. The Ripple foundation (or whatever they call themselves now) keeps unlocking billions of XRP from escrow and selling it straight into the market. Like clockwork. Retail gets excited about some vague announcement, and boom — here comes the dump. Every. Single. Time.

And can we talk about use case for a second? Who is actually using RippleNet? Like, seriously. Go ahead, I’ll wait. There’s no real volume. No big adoption. Just partnerships that sound impressive on paper and end up being “pilots” that go nowhere. It’s all smoke. And mirrors. And more smoke.

Meanwhile, the banks Ripple was supposed to “disrupt” have made it clear they want stablecoins. Not XRP. Not volatile tokens that dump 30% on a Tuesday because the market hiccupped. They want compliance-friendly, fiat-pegged coins they can actually use without scaring off regulators. USDC, USDT, maybe a CBDC or two — not your grandma’s XRP bag.

And yes, let’s not forget the lawsuits and the regulatory “clarity” that’s always juuuust around the corner. Same story since like 2018. At this point it’s just hopium. XRP isn’t a revolution, it’s a nostalgia project. Like MySpace for blockchain. Except MySpace had actual users.

The community’s down bad but still talking like it’s 2017 moon season. Wake up. Ripple isn’t taking over the banking world — it’s taking your liquidity and thanking you for the exit liquidity.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. Thanks for reading my rant and hope to see you on team bitcoin, to make an actual positive impact for our world and not just for the banks.

Following a notable performance over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a key level as support. Some analysts suggest a breakout toward the $3,000 mark could be coming if the $2,600 mark holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst Ethereum Prepares For Massive Breakout On Tuesday, Ethereum surged to the $2,700 resistance after a 6.3% price jump in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency climbed from the $2,500 support zone toward the recent resistance level, hitting the $2,712 mark before retracing. ETH has been unable to cross this zone after recording its three-month high of $2,738 two weeks ago, halting its retest of higher horizontal levels. Notably, the King of Altcoins has surged over 50% in the past month and around 98% from April’s lows. Amid the May crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of $111,953 last week, Ethereum has traded sideways for most of the month, hovering between the $2,450-$2,600 price range. Nonetheless, ETH has outperformed Bitcoin so far during the second quarter, registering a 47.78% increase since April started. Analyst The Cryptonomist pointed out that Ethereum has broken above the $2,600 level, signaling that a reclaim of this level could conclude ETH’s sideways action between its current price range and propel its price toward the $3,400 mark. Similarly, Crypto Bullet affirmed that ETH is “about to break out and fill the big CME Gap.” According to the chart, the Altcoin appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle over the past few weeks, and is currently attempting to break out from the formation. A successful breakout and retest of the $2,700 level could send ETH’s price to the CME GAP levels, between $2,900 and $3,350, which other analysts also believe will be filled soon. ETH Dominance To Surge In June? Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum Dominance is “showcasing initial signs of trying to hold the ~9% level as support,” suggesting a potential bullish performance in June. As the analyst explained, ETH dominance has bounced since dropping to new All-Time Lows (ATL) last month, playing out “the full extent of its September 2019 upside.” Keeping this level as support could propel the cryptocurrency to a more market-dominant performance next month, resembling its 2019 playbook. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move Market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum’s chart “is screaming bullish,” showing a multi-year base and “clean” bullish pennant pattern. To the trader, this setup could launch the cryptocurrency to a long-term target of $8,000 after breaking above the $3,000 mark. Additionally, ETH is preparing for the cycle’s “final pump,” according to Merlijn, based on its previous performances. He pointed out that Ethereum “goes vertical” after breaking its previous high every cycle. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,686, an 8.8% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Dogecoin has yet to hit its previous $0.74 all-time high from 2021, but nevertheless, $1 has remained the target for the altcoin this cycle. This is due to the expectation of another altcoin season that could send the price on a similar run that was seen in 2021. However, if the Dogecoin price were to actually see a repeat of what happened in the past two previous bull cycles, then the $1 mark may only be a starting point, given how high the price could go. Dogecoin Price Mirroring Past Cycles Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has noticed an eerily similar pattern on the Dogecoin price chart that could suggest a rapid upward movement is coming. This pattern is similar to what was seen in the last two bullish cycles, right as the meme coin’s price was preparing for lift-off. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out As the chart shows, this pattern first emerged leading up to the bullish rally in 2017.

Following a notable performance over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a key level as support. Some analysts suggest a breakout toward the $3,000 mark could be coming if the $2,600 mark holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst Ethereum Prepares For Massive Breakout On Tuesday, Ethereum surged to the $2,700 resistance after a 6.3% price jump in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency climbed from the $2,500 support zone toward the recent resistance level, hitting the $2,712 mark before retracing. ETH has been unable to cross this zone after recording its three-month high of $2,738 two weeks ago, halting its retest of higher horizontal levels. Notably, the King of Altcoins has surged over 50% in the past month and around 98% from April’s lows. Amid the May crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of $111,953 last week, Ethereum has traded sideways for most of the month, hovering between the $2,450-$2,600 price range. Nonetheless, ETH has outperformed Bitcoin so far during the second quarter, registering a 47.78% increase since April started. Analyst The Cryptonomist pointed out that Ethereum has broken above the $2,600 level, signaling that a reclaim of this level could conclude ETH’s sideways action between its current price range and propel its price toward the $3,400 mark. Similarly, Crypto Bullet affirmed that ETH is “about to break out and fill the big CME Gap.” According to the chart, the Altcoin appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle over the past few weeks, and is currently attempting to break out from the formation. A successful breakout and retest of the $2,700 level could send ETH’s price to the CME GAP levels, between $2,900 and $3,350, which other analysts also believe will be filled soon. ETH Dominance To Surge In June? Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum Dominance is “showcasing initial signs of trying to hold the ~9% level as support,” suggesting a potential bullish performance in June. As the analyst explained, ETH dominance has bounced since dropping to new All-Time Lows (ATL) last month, playing out “the full extent of its September 2019 upside.” Keeping this level as support could propel the cryptocurrency to a more market-dominant performance next month, resembling its 2019 playbook. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move Market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum’s chart “is screaming bullish,” showing a multi-year base and “clean” bullish pennant pattern.

Just crossed with this Leon bullish [Tweet ](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1927582921998913907)talking about more impressive Ethereum ecosystem metrics and its amazing how Ethereum keeps growing!

https://preview.redd.it/tvo95bxilg3f1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=abd4711aa6001ad45d8033a873778c8480ca2b12

  
As you can see in the image above, we are witnessing more than just a little pump in price, we are witnessing how Ethereum's ecosystem keeps growing non stop and coming more alive than ever and data is here to prove it.

For example, active addresses are holding around 15 million which is a strong indicator that more users are interacting with the network and not just speculating with it. (Some will say here that they are a few persons with multiple wallets, FUDers)

Regarding multi chain users, they have increased by 9.4% hitting 617k. This showing again that people are not sticking to one chain and they are enjoying and exploring the broader Ethereum Universe from Arbitrum to Base to zkSync, etc.

Furthermore, Layer 2 dominance is up 5.8% showing that more activity is migrating off the mainnet on to efficient cost effective rollups. This is really good for scaling and its a sign of real adoption.

As you can see, Ethereum ecosystem is more alive than ever and its aligning perfectly with the current bullish momentum. This is not just whales playing games, this is organic growth happening under the hood. We are witnessing Ethereum evolution.

2025-05-28T19:45:01.392757+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Ready For $3,000 Breakout? Analysts Say Sideways Action Is About To End. Following a notable performance over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a key level as support. Some analysts suggest a breakout toward the $3,000 mark could be coming if the $2,600 mark holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst Ethereum Prepares For Massive Breakout On Tuesday, Ethereum surged to the $2,700 resistance after a 6.3% price jump in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency climbed from the $2,500 support zone toward the recent resistance level, hitting the $2,712 mark before retracing. ETH has been unable to cross this zone after recording its three-month high of $2,738 two weeks ago, halting its retest of higher horizontal levels. Notably, the King of Altcoins has surged over 50% in the past month and around 98% from April’s lows. Amid the May crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of $111,953 last week, Ethereum has traded sideways for most of the month, hovering between the $2,450-$2,600 price range. Nonetheless, ETH has outperformed Bitcoin so far during the second quarter, registering a 47.78% increase since April started. Analyst The Cryptonomist pointed out that Ethereum has broken above the $2,600 level, signaling that a reclaim of this level could conclude ETH’s sideways action between its current price range and propel its price toward the $3,400 mark. Similarly, Crypto Bullet affirmed that ETH is “about to break out and fill the big CME Gap.” According to the chart, the Altcoin appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle over the past few weeks, and is currently attempting to break out from the formation. A successful breakout and retest of the $2,700 level could send ETH’s price to the CME GAP levels, between $2,900 and $3,350, which other analysts also believe will be filled soon. ETH Dominance To Surge In June? Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum Dominance is “showcasing initial signs of trying to hold the ~9% level as support,” suggesting a potential bullish performance in June. As the analyst explained, ETH dominance has bounced since dropping to new All-Time Lows (ATL) last month, playing out “the full extent of its September 2019 upside.” Keeping this level as support could propel the cryptocurrency to a more market-dominant performance next month, resembling its 2019 playbook. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move Market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum’s chart “is screaming bullish,” showing a multi-year base and “clean” bullish pennant pattern. To the trader, this setup could launch the cryptocurrency to a long-term target of $8,000 after breaking above the $3,000 mark. Additionally, ETH is preparing for the cycle’s “final pump,” according to Merlijn, based on its previous performances. He pointed out that Ethereum “goes vertical” after breaking its previous high every cycle. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,686, an 8.8% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-05-28T19:45:01.392757+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself. Dogecoin has yet to hit its previous $0.74 all-time high from 2021, but nevertheless, $1 has remained the target for the altcoin this cycle. This is due to the expectation of another altcoin season that could send the price on a similar run that was seen in 2021. However, if the Dogecoin price were to actually see a repeat of what happened in the past two previous bull cycles, then the $1 mark may only be a starting point, given how high the price could go. Dogecoin Price Mirroring Past Cycles Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has noticed an eerily similar pattern on the Dogecoin price chart that could suggest a rapid upward movement is coming. This pattern is similar to what was seen in the last two bullish cycles, right as the meme coin’s price was preparing for lift-off. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out As the chart shows, this pattern first emerged leading up to the bullish rally in 2017. It starts out a couple of years before as the altcoin’s price makes lower peaks and then trends down for a retest. After this, there is a period of consolidation before the trend is broken and an upward rally begins. In the 2017-2018 bull market, this pattern saw the Dogecoin price rally by more than 2,000%, going from below $0.00018 to above $0.0075 in a matter of months. Then again, in the 2020-2021 bull market, a similar pattern had formed right before the rally, ending in a breakout from consolidation. Interestingly, this time around, the resulting breakout was even more prominent, with the meme coin’s price rising by more than 30,000%. This saw a range from below $0.002 to above $0.73 in a matter of months. This is still the highest level that the Dogecoin price has reached so far. Once again, a similar pattern has emerged, and it looks like Dogecoin is on the brink of the next breakout. Going by the previous cycle performances and the steady uptrend, it is possible that the current breakout will see a higher ROI than previous cycles. But, there are now market cap constraints on how high the meme coin can go. Related Reading: Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue Nevertheless, even if the Dogecoin price were to manage a similar rise like the 2017-2018 cycle, the price would reach $4 minimum from here. Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, though, he expects the Dogecoin price to actually cross the double-digit threshold, putting it as high as $12. However, given Dogecoin’s high supply sitting above 149 billion coins, the possibilities of this happening this cycle are very slim. A $12 price tag would put the meme coin at a market cap above 1.7 trillion, something that even Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has yet to achieve.

As you can see in the image above, we are witnessing more than just a little pump in price, we are witnessing how Ethereum's ecosystem keeps growing non stop and coming more alive than ever and data is here to prove it.

For example, active addresses are holding around 15 million which is a strong indicator that more users are interacting with the network and not just speculating with it. (Some will say here that they are a few persons with multiple wallets, FUDers)

Regarding multi chain users, they have increased by 9.4% hitting 617k. This showing again that people are not sticking to one chain and they are enjoying and exploring the broader Ethereum Universe from Arbitrum to Base to zkSync, etc.

Furthermore, Layer 2 dominance is up 5.8% showing that more activity is migrating off the mainnet on to efficient cost effective rollups. This is really good for scaling and its a sign of real adoption.

As you can see, Ethereum ecosystem is more alive than ever and its aligning perfectly with the current bullish momentum. This is not just whales playing games, this is organic growth happening under the hood. We are witnessing Ethereum evolution.

2025-05-28T20:45:01.472057+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself. Dogecoin has yet to hit its previous $0.74 all-time high from 2021, but nevertheless, $1 has remained the target for the altcoin this cycle. This is due to the expectation of another altcoin season that could send the price on a similar run that was seen in 2021. However, if the Dogecoin price were to actually see a repeat of what happened in the past two previous bull cycles, then the $1 mark may only be a starting point, given how high the price could go. Dogecoin Price Mirroring Past Cycles Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has noticed an eerily similar pattern on the Dogecoin price chart that could suggest a rapid upward movement is coming. This pattern is similar to what was seen in the last two bullish cycles, right as the meme coin’s price was preparing for lift-off. Related Reading: Cardano: Elliot Wave Predicts 50% Crash For ADA Price, Is It Time To Get Out As the chart shows, this pattern first emerged leading up to the bullish rally in 2017. It starts out a couple of years before as the altcoin’s price makes lower peaks and then trends down for a retest. After this, there is a period of consolidation before the trend is broken and an upward rally begins. In the 2017-2018 bull market, this pattern saw the Dogecoin price rally by more than 2,000%, going from below $0.00018 to above $0.0075 in a matter of months. Then again, in the 2020-2021 bull market, a similar pattern had formed right before the rally, ending in a breakout from consolidation. Interestingly, this time around, the resulting breakout was even more prominent, with the meme coin’s price rising by more than 30,000%. This saw a range from below $0.002 to above $0.73 in a matter of months. This is still the highest level that the Dogecoin price has reached so far. Once again, a similar pattern has emerged, and it looks like Dogecoin is on the brink of the next breakout. Going by the previous cycle performances and the steady uptrend, it is possible that the current breakout will see a higher ROI than previous cycles. But, there are now market cap constraints on how high the meme coin can go. Related Reading: Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue Nevertheless, even if the Dogecoin price were to manage a similar rise like the 2017-2018 cycle, the price would reach $4 minimum from here. Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, though, he expects the Dogecoin price to actually cross the double-digit threshold, putting it as high as $12. However, given Dogecoin’s high supply sitting above 149 billion coins, the possibilities of this happening this cycle are very slim. A $12 price tag would put the meme coin at a market cap above 1.7 trillion, something that even Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has yet to achieve.

For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.</p><p>Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There&rsquo;s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports<strong> </strong>the vision of a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/cryptocurrency-vs-stocks-key-differences-explained"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">better financial system</a>. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.</p><h2>Physical infrastructure is the missing link</h2><p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/arizona-governor-vetoes-crypto-bills-approves-bitcoin-atm-law"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/arizona-governor-vetoes-crypto-bills-approves-bitcoin-atm-law""><em><strong>Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMs</strong></em></a></p><p>For crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people&rsquo;s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don&rsquo;t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation <a href=""https://www.fdic.gov/household-survey"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">report</a>, around 5.6 million American households don&rsquo;t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.</p><h2>User-friendly screen in the right place</h2><p>Physical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.</p><p>These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto&rsquo;s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.</p><h2>The crypto industry&rsquo;s blind spot</h2><p>The industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.</p><p>As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.</p><p>Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.</p><p>The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for.&nbsp;</p><p>According to<a href=""https://coinatmradar.com/country/226/bitcoin-atm-united-states/"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> Coin ATM Radar</a>, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It&rsquo;s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto&rsquo;s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T21:45:02.265620+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound. Dogecoin is currently trading around critical levels, consolidating just below the key $0.25 resistance zone. After a period of relative calm, momentum is beginning to build as bullish sentiment returns to the altcoin market. With Bitcoin holding near all-time highs and Ethereum pushing higher, analysts are calling for the start of a long-awaited altseason—and Dogecoin is showing early signs of participation. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Price action has remained constructive, with DOGE defending higher lows and gradually tightening within a key range. Now, traders are closely watching for a breakout above the $0.25 level, which could unlock the next phase of upside. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical signal worth noting: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on Dogecoin’s hourly chart. Historically, this pattern has preceded short-term rebounds and local trend reversals, especially when confirmed near key support zones. As sentiment improves and capital begins rotating into high-beta altcoins, Dogecoin appears well-positioned for a potential move. If bulls can push through resistance and validate the TD signal with follow-through volume, DOGE may quickly retest higher levels last seen during early-year surges. The coming sessions could be pivotal. Dogecoin Consolidates As Buy Signal Hints At Incoming Breakout Dogecoin is showing signs of renewed strength, consolidating within a key range between $0.21 and $0.25. After a powerful surge of over 90% since early April, DOGE has cooled off slightly, but remains firmly within bullish territory. The recent price action has been marked by steadily higher lows and a tightening range structure, suggesting that the asset is gearing up for its next major move. The $0.25 resistance remains a critical level to watch. A confirmed breakout above this zone could open the door to a more aggressive rally and shift market sentiment decisively in favor of the bulls. However, momentum has slowed in recent days, and global macroeconomic uncertainty—particularly surrounding inflation and interest rate expectations—continues to weigh on risk assets across the board. Despite these challenges, optimism persists. Martinez recently pointed to a TD Sequential buy signal that has appeared on the 1-hour chart for Dogecoin. This indicator, known for predicting trend reversals and short-term impulses, tends to be particularly effective when it flashes during consolidation phases like the current one. If confirmed, the signal could provide the spark needed to push DOGE back toward the $0.25 resistance—and potentially beyond. For now, bulls must continue to defend the $0.21 support level while looking for momentum to build above the current range. If broader market conditions remain favorable and DOGE can reclaim $0.25 with volume, a new leg higher may follow. Until then, the setup remains constructive, with strong technical support and early signals pointing toward a possible breakout. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? DOGE Consolidates Below Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.222, consolidating after a strong rally in early May. The chart shows price holding within a tight range between $0.21 and $0.25, with the $0.25 level acting as strong resistance. Despite recent pullbacks, DOGE continues to trade above its key moving averages, signaling that bullish structure remains intact in the short term. The 34 EMA (green) at $0.2112 is providing dynamic support, while the 50 SMA (blue) at $0.1929 reinforces a solid base just below. The 200 SMA (red), currently at $0.2714, is the next significant resistance if DOGE breaks out above $0.25. Volume has decreased slightly during this consolidation, a typical sign of a market pausing before a potential breakout or breakdown. The lack of aggressive selling pressure suggests that bulls are still in control, but need renewed momentum to challenge and reclaim the $0.25 level.

A clean break and close above $0.25 would likely confirm the continuation of the bullish trend, potentially targeting the $0.28–$0.30 range.

2025-05-29T19:03:14.782411+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Market Outlook: Technical Indicators Signal Possible Continuation of Uptrend. Ethereum (ETH), the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency, has experienced considerable price fluctuations recently, trading at approximately $2,633 at the time of writing. The asset registered a mild decline of 1.2% over the past 24 hours, retreating slightly after surpassing the $2,700 mark last week. Despite this short-term retracement, Ethereum has notably appreciated by around 50% within the past month, demonstrating strong price strength and significant market interest. The recent price action has attracted attention from prominent cryptocurrency analysts, particularly from CryptoQuant contributors, who have closely monitored Ethereum’s technical indicators and market behaviors. These analysts have provided insights that suggest potential further movement for ETH, pointing towards critical levels and market metrics that investors might want to observe closely. Related Reading: Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns Ethereum&#8217;s Bullish Technical Indicators and Potential Breakout CryptoQuant analyst Ibrahim Cosar recently published a technical analysis outlining a bullish scenario for ETH. According to Cosar, Ethereum has formed a pattern known as a &#8220;bull flag,&#8221; suggesting a possible upcoming breakout. A bull flag is a chart formation frequently interpreted by traders as indicative of continuing upward momentum after a period of consolidation. Ethereum’s price has oscillated within a defined range between $2,400 and $2,700 for nearly three weeks, creating favorable conditions for such a breakout. Cosar also highlighted Ethereum’s sustained position above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a commonly monitored technical indicator. Historically, remaining consistently above this indicator has signified positive market sentiment and preceded significant price rallies. Given Ethereum&#8217;s current position relative to this EMA, Cosar suggested a potential upward move toward a price range between $3,000 and $3,500 could soon materialize. Market-Wide Implications and Retail Activity Another CryptoQuant analyst known as &#8220;elcryptotavo&#8221; offered a complementary perspective, identifying signals that typically indicate market peaks. Specifically, the analyst mentioned Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI), noting that a notable market signal occurs when Ethereum&#8217;s OI surpasses Bitcoin’s, a scenario historically correlated with market tops. Currently, ETH has yet to reach this critical threshold, suggesting, according to this analyst, potential room for further upside before significant corrections could occur. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Elcryptotavo also provided observations regarding retail trading behaviors. Typically, retail trading activity surges dramatically near market tops, reflecting broad market participation. However, current data on retail trading volumes remain comparatively subdued. This observation implies that institutional investors or large market players are predominantly driving Ethereum&#8217;s current rally. A significant increase in retail participation, should it occur, could further sustain and accelerate Ethereum’s upward momentum, a phenomenon previously seen during the 2020–2021 bull cycle.

2025-05-29T19:03:14.782411+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Is About To Enter It’s Worst Month In History – Why June Could Be Bloody. With the month of May drawing to a quick close, it looks like the Dogecoin price is about to end its second month in a row in the green. This has come as a welcome surprise in a month where expectations were that the market would continue to go down. However, this means that Dogecoin is about to enter what has historically been the worst month since its inception, with more red closes than green. Why The Dogecoin Price Could Go Down In June The month of June has been known to be very bad for the Dogecoin price, and this has been the case for most of the last 11 years. In more than a decade, the Dogecoin price has only closed out the month of June in the green twice, and this was back when it was still a rather new cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Forget Dogecoin At $1: Price Could Rally To $12 If History Repeats Itself As data from the CryptoRank website shows, the only years that the month of June has ended in the green for Dogecoin have been 2015 and 2016. Before that, June 2014 had closed in the red, with a loss of 21.4%, and after 2016, Dogecoin had racked up losses for the month of June every single year. From 2017 to 2024, Dogecoin has ended the month of June in the red every single time without fail. June 2017 ended in -2.38%, June 2018 ended in 27.2%, June 2019 ended in -4.36%, June 2020 ended in -9.94%, June 2021 ended in -23.9%, June 2022 ended in -23.3%, June 2023 ended in -7.18%, and June 2024 ended in -21.9%. Looking at the pattern here, it shows that even during bullish years, the month of June has not failed to end in losses for Dogecoin. Going by this established trend, it is not far off to expect the Dogecoin price to actually fall in the new month. With an average return of -7.34% over the years, making it the worst month in terms of returns for the meme coin, a decline could be in the works for the cryptocurrency. What To Expect From Here According to the machine learning algorithm at CoinCodex, the month of June may end up deviating from its established pattern. At the start, it does show a possible decline, expecting the price to fall below $0.22. However, as the month progresses, it is expected to turn around.

Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength as it continues to trade above the $2,700 level, reaching as high as $2,790 in recent hours. The price action has energized the market, with many analysts now calling for a major breakout that could not only lift ETH further but also trigger the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg While Bitcoin has led the rally for most of the year, Ethereum appears to be catching up. According to top analyst Daan, the ETH spot premium remains firm, signaling sustained demand even in the absence of ETF-level inflows. “It doesn’t have as many ETF inflows as BTC does,” Daan noted. This relative strength, combined with growing optimism around altcoins, is fueling speculation that Ethereum could soon test—and possibly break—critical resistance levels. With sentiment turning bullish across the market and ETH gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether it can push past key resistance and lead the charge into a broader altcoin breakout. The coming days could prove pivotal as Ethereum sets the tone for the next phase of crypto market expansion. Ethereum Tests Critical Resistance As It Faces A Pivotal Moment Ethereum is now confronting what many analysts consider the most important resistance level of the current cycle. The zone between $2,700 and $2,800 has become the battleground for ETH’s next major move. A successful breakout could trigger a run toward all-time highs, while rejection may lead to a healthy—but deeper—retracement. Global macro conditions are adding weight to this moment. Rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation continue to rattle traditional markets, increasing systemic stress. Yet, in this uncertain environment, Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown resilience, suggesting that investors are increasingly viewing them as alternatives or hedges against traditional financial risks. Daan shared insights reinforcing this bullish outlook. According to his analysis, the ETH spot premium remains firm despite lacking the ETF-driven inflows seen with Bitcoin. ETH doesn’t require as much inflow relative to its market cap to sustain bullish momentum. However, the $2,800 level remains a significant barrier. It represents a key inflection point for Ethereum’s price action and overall market sentiment. The coming days are crucial, as Ethereum’s ability to either break above or get rejected at this resistance could shape the altcoin market’s direction for the rest of the quarter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Price Analysis: Testing Key Liquidity Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $2,731 on the 4-hour chart, showing strong bullish momentum as it tests the key $2,800 resistance level. After weeks of consolidation between $2,500 and $2,700, ETH has broken out with conviction, riding higher moving averages and increased volume. The 34 EMA at $2,622 and the 50 SMA at $2,598 continue to act as dynamic support, confirming the strength of the uptrend. This breakout attempt follows a long period of compression, where ETH built a base of higher lows. Price has now surged to challenge a major resistance zone that has historically capped upward momentum. If bulls manage to flip this level into support, it could open the door to a sharp move toward $3,000 and higher. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure?

2025-05-29T22:45:09.374080+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Forms Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern To Suggest Quick Reversal To $0.25. Dogecoin has flipped into negative price territory in a seven-day timeframe, with the meme coin currently down by 6.11% in the past seven days. However, this price action has led to the emergence of a bullish pattern on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart.  The constructive formation follows a corrective drop that briefly pushed Dogecoin to $0.215, but recent trading sessions have seen higher lows and firmer support levels. This, in turn, has led to the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern that points to quick bullish targets for the Dogecoin price. Analyst Identifies Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Crypto analyst Klejdi Cuni posted a technical outlook on social media platform X, highlighting an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the DOGE/USDT chart on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe. The setup consists of three distinct troughs, with the central one being the deepest and forming on May 25th. The right shoulder, on the other hand, formed between May 23 and May 24, bringing rise to what could be interpreted as a short-term bullish reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Bearish Trendline And Enters Ascending Channel Headed For $0.3 According to the analyst, this particular inverse head and shoulders is a smaller-scale formation, making it more relevant for short-term traders looking for quick movements. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is still in the process of completing the left shoulder, as it is now testing the neckline resistance around $0.228. A breakout above this neckline level with enough volume confirmation could trigger a swift move upwards. Short-Term Upside Targets For Dogecoin If the bullish inverse head and shoulders setup unfolds as expected, the analyst predicted a Dogecoin price surge first toward the $0.239 zone.

A rally to $0.25 would be a full recovery to Dogecoin’s most recent local peak in May. This, in turn, could be the start of a rally continuation to higher price levels toward $0.3 and beyond.

2025-05-29T23:45:01.547631+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus. Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength as it continues to trade above the $2,700 level, reaching as high as $2,790 in recent hours. The price action has energized the market, with many analysts now calling for a major breakout that could not only lift ETH further but also trigger the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg While Bitcoin has led the rally for most of the year, Ethereum appears to be catching up. According to top analyst Daan, the ETH spot premium remains firm, signaling sustained demand even in the absence of ETF-level inflows. “It doesn’t have as many ETF inflows as BTC does,” Daan noted. This relative strength, combined with growing optimism around altcoins, is fueling speculation that Ethereum could soon test—and possibly break—critical resistance levels. With sentiment turning bullish across the market and ETH gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether it can push past key resistance and lead the charge into a broader altcoin breakout. The coming days could prove pivotal as Ethereum sets the tone for the next phase of crypto market expansion. Ethereum Tests Critical Resistance As It Faces A Pivotal Moment Ethereum is now confronting what many analysts consider the most important resistance level of the current cycle. The zone between $2,700 and $2,800 has become the battleground for ETH’s next major move. A successful breakout could trigger a run toward all-time highs, while rejection may lead to a healthy—but deeper—retracement. Global macro conditions are adding weight to this moment. Rising U.S. Treasury yields and persistent inflation continue to rattle traditional markets, increasing systemic stress. Yet, in this uncertain environment, Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown resilience, suggesting that investors are increasingly viewing them as alternatives or hedges against traditional financial risks. Daan shared insights reinforcing this bullish outlook. According to his analysis, the ETH spot premium remains firm despite lacking the ETF-driven inflows seen with Bitcoin. ETH doesn’t require as much inflow relative to its market cap to sustain bullish momentum. However, the $2,800 level remains a significant barrier. It represents a key inflection point for Ethereum’s price action and overall market sentiment. The coming days are crucial, as Ethereum’s ability to either break above or get rejected at this resistance could shape the altcoin market’s direction for the rest of the quarter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Price Analysis: Testing Key Liquidity Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $2,731 on the 4-hour chart, showing strong bullish momentum as it tests the key $2,800 resistance level. After weeks of consolidation between $2,500 and $2,700, ETH has broken out with conviction, riding higher moving averages and increased volume. The 34 EMA at $2,622 and the 50 SMA at $2,598 continue to act as dynamic support, confirming the strength of the uptrend. This breakout attempt follows a long period of compression, where ETH built a base of higher lows. Price has now surged to challenge a major resistance zone that has historically capped upward momentum. If bulls manage to flip this level into support, it could open the door to a sharp move toward $3,000 and higher. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? Volume has picked up on the most recent push, a positive sign that buyers are stepping in with more confidence.

2025-05-29T23:45:01.547631+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Forms Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern To Suggest Quick Reversal To $0.25. Dogecoin has flipped into negative price territory in a seven-day timeframe, with the meme coin currently down by 6.11% in the past seven days. However, this price action has led to the emergence of a bullish pattern on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart.  The constructive formation follows a corrective drop that briefly pushed Dogecoin to $0.215, but recent trading sessions have seen higher lows and firmer support levels. This, in turn, has led to the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern that points to quick bullish targets for the Dogecoin price. Analyst Identifies Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Crypto analyst Klejdi Cuni posted a technical outlook on social media platform X, highlighting an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the DOGE/USDT chart on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe. The setup consists of three distinct troughs, with the central one being the deepest and forming on May 25th. The right shoulder, on the other hand, formed between May 23 and May 24, bringing rise to what could be interpreted as a short-term bullish reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Bearish Trendline And Enters Ascending Channel Headed For $0.3 According to the analyst, this particular inverse head and shoulders is a smaller-scale formation, making it more relevant for short-term traders looking for quick movements. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is still in the process of completing the left shoulder, as it is now testing the neckline resistance around $0.228. A breakout above this neckline level with enough volume confirmation could trigger a swift move upwards. Short-Term Upside Targets For Dogecoin If the bullish inverse head and shoulders setup unfolds as expected, the analyst predicted a Dogecoin price surge first toward the $0.239 zone.

2025-05-30T02:45:02.062572+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Tests Key Weekly Resistance – Analyst Sets $4K Target If ETH Breaks Out. Ethereum is taking the lead in the crypto market as Bitcoin continues to consolidate near its all-time highs. After months of lagging behind BTC, ETH is now making a strong move, with bulls pushing price action toward the critical $2,800 resistance. This level, which has consistently capped upside momentum since early February, now stands as the key battleground for Ethereum’s next major leg. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Market sentiment has shifted as Ethereum shows signs of reclaiming dominance, driven by renewed spot demand and strengthening technicals. Top analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on the rally, emphasizing the importance of the $2,850 mark. According to Pillows, this is the most significant resistance Ethereum has faced in this cycle, and breaking through it could unlock a powerful move toward $3,000 and beyond. Momentum has been building steadily over the past few weeks, and ETH’s recent resilience against macroeconomic pressure is adding to the conviction. If bulls manage to flip this resistance into support, it could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin surge. For now, all eyes are on Ethereum as it flirts with a breakout that could reshape market dynamics heading into June. Ethereum Eyes Expansion Phase Amid Shifting Global Dynamics Ethereum is positioning itself for a potentially expansive move as both technical indicators and market sentiment continue to align in its favor. After weeks of consolidation and steady gains, ETH is now testing the $2,850 resistance—a level that has held price down since February. The setup suggests that Ethereum is not only regaining momentum but could also lead the next phase of the crypto rally. While the crypto market gains traction, broader macroeconomic forces are reshaping investor behavior. A recent decision by the U.S. Federal court to strike down former President Trump’s tariffs on various countries has created fresh uncertainty across global markets. This policy reversal could introduce volatility in traditional finance, as trade dynamics shift and new fiscal responses take shape. Despite this uncertainty, Ethereum appears to be thriving. There&#8217;s a view that crypto assets like ETH could perform well under tight economic conditions, and current price action supports that view. ETH is showing resilience, supported by growing spot demand, a bullish structure, and rising investor confidence. Pillows highlighted in his latest analysis that if Ethereum reclaims the $2,850 level in the coming sessions, the path to $4,000 will open quickly. This would represent a major breakout and likely trigger a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin and stablecoins into altcoins. For now, ETH remains just below a breakout point. If bulls can push decisively above resistance, it would confirm the start of an expansionary move that could reshape the broader market, positioning Ethereum as a leading force in the next phase of the cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound ETH Reclaims Weekly Key Levels Ethereum is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, currently trading at $2,728.36 after reaching a high of $2,789.50. This move marks a significant recovery from recent lows near $1,600 and confirms the formation of a strong uptrend. ETH has now reclaimed the 34-week EMA at $2,511.42 and is pushing above the 100-week SMA at $2,605.71. These moving averages now act as dynamic support levels, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The next critical level to watch is the 50-week SMA, currently sitting at $2,729.64, just slightly above the current price. A confirmed weekly close above this level would mark the first time ETH has sustained strength above it since late 2023. That could open the door for a push toward the $3,200–$3,600 zone, with $4,000 in sight if momentum accelerates. Volume has also picked up on this recent move, signaling healthy participation from buyers. Historically, similar recoveries from major moving average clusters have preceded expansive legs in Ethereum&#8217;s price.

2025-05-30T02:45:02.062572+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Forms Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern To Suggest Quick Reversal To $0.25. Dogecoin has flipped into negative price territory in a seven-day timeframe, with the meme coin currently down by 6.11% in the past seven days. However, this price action has led to the emergence of a bullish pattern on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart.  The constructive formation follows a corrective drop that briefly pushed Dogecoin to $0.215, but recent trading sessions have seen higher lows and firmer support levels. This, in turn, has led to the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern that points to quick bullish targets for the Dogecoin price. Analyst Identifies Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Crypto analyst Klejdi Cuni posted a technical outlook on social media platform X, highlighting an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the DOGE/USDT chart on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe. The setup consists of three distinct troughs, with the central one being the deepest and forming on May 25th. The right shoulder, on the other hand, formed between May 23 and May 24, bringing rise to what could be interpreted as a short-term bullish reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Bearish Trendline And Enters Ascending Channel Headed For $0.3 According to the analyst, this particular inverse head and shoulders is a smaller-scale formation, making it more relevant for short-term traders looking for quick movements. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is still in the process of completing the left shoulder, as it is now testing the neckline resistance around $0.228. A breakout above this neckline level with enough volume confirmation could trigger a swift move upwards. Short-Term Upside Targets For Dogecoin If the bullish inverse head and shoulders setup unfolds as expected, the analyst predicted a Dogecoin price surge first toward the $0.239 zone. This level acted as a support level for many hours on May 22, before eventually breaking down and acting as resistance during a brief upward attempt in the late hours of May 23. As such, this area would be important to note, as a successful breach would then open the door to the next target. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Setting Classic Move To $0.5 If This Level Breaks The next short-term price target if Dogecoin successfully clears $0.239 is at $0.25. Though modest in comparison to some of the more aggressive long and medium-term projections, this level is important for a different reason. A rally to $0.25 would be a full recovery to Dogecoin’s most recent local peak in May. This, in turn, could be the start of a rally continuation to higher price levels toward $0.3 and beyond. The chart projection above outlines a step-wise movement where the breakout leads to immediate upside action, followed by consolidation before a secondary leg pushes the Dogecoin price to $0.25. However, as with any pattern, confirmation is important. Failure to hold the breakout zone or a breakdown below the right shoulder, which is currently around $0.222, would weaken the bullish outlook and could lead to a retest of $0.21.

2025-05-30T05:45:08.366915+00:00,Ethereum,Reddit,"zkSync’s Validium TL;DR if you’re curious

Been reading up on zkSync’s Validium mode and figured I’d share a quick rundown and ask for opinions lol. 

It’s basically zk rollups, but cheaper and faster because it keeps transaction data off chain. You still get zk proofs on Ethereum to prove everything’s legit, but the actual data isn’t posted to L1.
Pros that I personally liked 
1) Way cheaper tx fees
2)Higher throughput (think: games, NFTs, social apps)
3)Still uses zk proofs, so it’s not just “trust us”
Cons:
1)Data availability is off-chain, so if the data provider disappears… oof
2) Not ideal for serious DeFi or anything where you need Ethereum-level guarantees


zkSync is also working on “volitions” where users can choose per tx whether to store data on-chain (rollup) or off chain (Validium), which is kinda neat.
Anyone actually building with this?
Some of the project like sophon, a consumer focus platform listed their token on bitget and is also using Zksync validium tech. Apart from that even GRVT,lens network are one of them.

Any other views or opinions on validium or its popularity/hype  these days ?

Ethereum is taking the lead in the crypto market as Bitcoin continues to consolidate near its all-time highs. After months of lagging behind BTC, ETH is now making a strong move, with bulls pushing price action toward the critical $2,800 resistance. This level, which has consistently capped upside momentum since early February, now stands as the key battleground for Ethereum’s next major leg. Related Reading: Altseason Loading? Analyst Explains How FTX $5B Distribution May Trigger The Next Bull Leg Market sentiment has shifted as Ethereum shows signs of reclaiming dominance, driven by renewed spot demand and strengthening technicals. Top analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on the rally, emphasizing the importance of the $2,850 mark. According to Pillows, this is the most significant resistance Ethereum has faced in this cycle, and breaking through it could unlock a powerful move toward $3,000 and beyond. Momentum has been building steadily over the past few weeks, and ETH’s recent resilience against macroeconomic pressure is adding to the conviction. If bulls manage to flip this resistance into support, it could mark the beginning of a broader altcoin surge. For now, all eyes are on Ethereum as it flirts with a breakout that could reshape market dynamics heading into June. Ethereum Eyes Expansion Phase Amid Shifting Global Dynamics Ethereum is positioning itself for a potentially expansive move as both technical indicators and market sentiment continue to align in its favor. After weeks of consolidation and steady gains, ETH is now testing the $2,850 resistance—a level that has held price down since February. The setup suggests that Ethereum is not only regaining momentum but could also lead the next phase of the crypto rally. While the crypto market gains traction, broader macroeconomic forces are reshaping investor behavior. A recent decision by the U.S. Federal court to strike down former President Trump’s tariffs on various countries has created fresh uncertainty across global markets. This policy reversal could introduce volatility in traditional finance, as trade dynamics shift and new fiscal responses take shape. Despite this uncertainty, Ethereum appears to be thriving. There&#8217;s a view that crypto assets like ETH could perform well under tight economic conditions, and current price action supports that view. ETH is showing resilience, supported by growing spot demand, a bullish structure, and rising investor confidence. Pillows highlighted in his latest analysis that if Ethereum reclaims the $2,850 level in the coming sessions, the path to $4,000 will open quickly. This would represent a major breakout and likely trigger a wave of capital rotation from Bitcoin and stablecoins into altcoins. For now, ETH remains just below a breakout point. If bulls can push decisively above resistance, it would confirm the start of an expansionary move that could reshape the broader market, positioning Ethereum as a leading force in the next phase of the cycle.

This move marks a significant recovery from recent lows near $1,600 and confirms the formation of a strong uptrend. ETH has now reclaimed the 34-week EMA at $2,511.42 and is pushing above the 100-week SMA at $2,605.71. These moving averages now act as dynamic support levels, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The next critical level to watch is the 50-week SMA, currently sitting at $2,729.64, just slightly above the current price. A confirmed weekly close above this level would mark the first time ETH has sustained strength above it since late 2023. That could open the door for a push toward the $3,200–$3,600 zone, with $4,000 in sight if momentum accelerates. Volume has also picked up on this recent move, signaling healthy participation from buyers. Historically, similar recoveries from major moving average clusters have preceded expansive legs in Ethereum&#8217;s price.

The breakout above $2,850—last defended in early 2024—remains the final hurdle before Ethereum can challenge prior cycle highs. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0629821015664389,

2025-05-30T06:45:01.515244+00:00,Ethereum,Reddit,"zkSync’s Validium TL;DR if you’re curious

Been reading up on zkSync’s Validium mode and figured I’d share a quick rundown and ask for opinions lol. 

It’s basically zk rollups, but cheaper and faster because it keeps transaction data off chain. You still get zk proofs on Ethereum to prove everything’s legit, but the actual data isn’t posted to L1.
Pros that I personally liked 
1) Way cheaper tx fees
2)Higher throughput (think: games, NFTs, social apps)
3)Still uses zk proofs, so it’s not just “trust us”
Cons:
1)Data availability is off-chain, so if the data provider disappears… oof
2) Not ideal for serious DeFi or anything where you need Ethereum-level guarantees


zkSync is also working on “volitions” where users can choose per tx whether to store data on-chain (rollup) or off chain (Validium), which is kinda neat.
Anyone actually building with this?
Some of the project like sophon, a consumer focus platform listed their token on bitget and is also using Zksync validium tech. Apart from that even GRVT,lens network are one of them.

Any other views or opinions on validium or its popularity/hype  these days ?
