I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:26:48.225644+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:45:53.710510+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:52:02.260841+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:12:48.365447+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:40:14.850692+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T22:00:48.460170+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally. Dogecoin may be gearing up for its next major move as technical signals begin to turn in the bull’s favor. After a period of consolidation and downward pressure, DOGE has broken out of a falling wedge pattern, one of the most reliable bullish reversal formations in technical analysis. This breakout suggests that the meme coin could be on the verge of a potential rally, especially as momentum begins to build within a key price zone.  How The Falling Wedge And Rounded Bottom Favor Bulls In a recent post on X, a crypto analyst with the username “TitaniumXBTC” spotlighted an encouraging technical setup on Dogecoin’s chart. The expert emphasized that DOGE has successfully broken out of a falling wedge formation while completing a rounded bottom formation. These two chart patterns, when combined, often signal the exhaustion of a downtrend and the start of a potential uptrend, laying a strong foundation for future price appreciation. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Struggles to Sustain Gain as Meme Coin Mania Cools Off The analyst pointed out that this breakout has already been validated, with Dogecoin gaining momentum as it pushes beyond the key resistance area. The bullish pressure appears to be accelerating within the highlighted zone, suggesting that buyers are stepping in with growing conviction. This move, if sustained, strengthens the case for a mid-to-long-term rally, with the breakout zone acting as a launchpad for further gains.  Despite the optimism, the expert cautioned that confirmation is necessary. Should the breakout hold and attract continued interest, Dogecoin could be poised to reclaim higher levels and potentially ignite a broader trend reversal. With bullish energy building, all eyes are now on DOGE to see if it can capitalize on this momentum and deliver on the promising setup. Dogecoin Bullish Path Ahead: Target Zones After The Breakout According to the crypto expert, the key price levels to watch for DOGE in the near-to-mid term are $0.3757, $0.4884, and $0.6160. These targets have been identified based on the breakout from the falling wedge pattern and alignment with historical resistance zones that could come into play as the rally progresses. Each of these levels represents a potential milestone where momentum may pause, consolidate, or even reverse, depending on overall market sentiment and trading volume.

Reaching these zones may attract increased attention from investors looking for profit-taking opportunities, or even fuel additional rallies if broken with strong volume.
