I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:26:48.225644+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:45:53.710510+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers.

A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

I dont expect anyone to have an absolute certainty on the direction of the market but I am curious on your opinions and the information as to why you think it will perform that way.

Im currently not sure on which way its going to go. On one hand, I believe theres definitely room and enough market interest for it to have another mid level price spike. For example, I believe by the end of the month there is a potential for say, ethereum, to reach 2.9-3.1k.

On the other hand, I see the current trend and the RSI at 67 or so for most top crypto meaning that the volatility is expected to be ridiculous and it is highly and reasonably likely to continue crashing down to 1,100-1500 by the end of this month potentially by mid June with a bottom hitting sometime in early July. 

The market excitement is why I think it could go up, along with the fact that bitcoin is showing promise due to a handful of macro issues facing the united states. Assuming bitcoin is accepted and utilized as a safe haven asset.

The market trends and indicators are why I think the market is heading towards the summer bottom of the cycle. With a belief that we will only see a real uptick again early to mid August with the last peak of the season hitting sometime between the end of October and the beginning of next January. But I believe that this peak will likely out perform the beginning of this run barring any significant macro concerns.

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T19:52:02.260841+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:12:48.365447+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-19T20:40:14.850692+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash. Dogecoin is currently showing signs of selling pressure after shedding much of the bullish momentum it had gathered in late April and early May. Technical analysis of the Dogecoin price shows that the meme cryptocurrency is precariously hovering just above a key support level that puts it one step away from a downtrend.  Crypto analyst RLinda noted this level, set at $0.214, on the TradingView platform, labeling it a retest of the panic zone.  Related Reading: XRP 100x Gains Coming? The Future Is Closer Than You Think—Analyst Panic Zone Under Retest Due To Dogecoin Correction According to RLinda’s analysis, Dogecoin&#8217;s distribution phase between May 9 and 11 ended in the $0.2600 range, eventually marking the end of its latest bullish impulse. During this distribution phase, Dogecoin squandered all the potential it had accumulated in late April and early May. From that point, the price has been falling steadily, entering what the analyst describes as the correction or dump phase. This has caused the meme coin to test the 0.214 level, the current panic zone. A confirmed breakdown below this panic zone, particularly beneath the 0.2135 support line, would not only liquidate long positions but also likely intensify selling pressure, eventually leading to what could become an uncontrolled price decline. Interestingly, this correction price action has been characterized by lower highs, leading to the formation of a triangle pattern that&#8217;s visible on the 2-hour timeframe. RLinda warned that if the triangle&#8217;s base is broken, this structural failure could reinforce bearish sentiment. This would open the door to downside targets closer to $0.20 and possibly even $0.19. Dogecoin Resistance And Support Levels To Watch The immediate resistance lies at $0.222 and $0.2307, representing key zones Dogecoin must reclaim to negate the current bearish setup. A move above these points, especially if the price consolidates above $0.23, will invalidate the bearish breakdown structure and could renew bullish sentiment. However, RLinda made it clear that such a scenario is only worth considering after a clear confirmation, as current momentum still favors sellers. Related Reading: Trump Token Mania: Over 6,000% Pump Or Classic Solana Trap? On the other hand, support levels of $0.2145 and $0.2135 are currently the final shields holding back further declines. A close below $0.2135 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend and push the Dogecoin price into a lower consolidation zone, with limited immediate support until $0.20126 and $0.19298. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.22, up 1.72% over the past 24 hours. This slight recovery hints at early signs of strength and may already be undermining the bearish setup. Although this slight recovery is not enough on its own to confirm a bullish reversal, it does show that buyers are attempting to regain some control. If this momentum can be sustained into the new week, it could gradually pave the way for a more sustained move higher for Dogecoin during the week.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

Just crossed this morning with a few Tweets claiming something Vitalik proposed and after a research I found it [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-local-node-favoring-delta-to-the-scaling-roadmap/22368)

https://preview.redd.it/en0dk3j7ko1f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a41b1d9afff79df249af996f24898f7d789a1d8

Vitalik Buterin just dropped a new and fresh L1 scaling roadmap for Ethereum and it comes with spicy upgrades that looks to supercharge performance without making it hell to for nodes.

The plan centers around EIP-4444 and Stateless clients but giving another think about what full nodes should be doing in the first place.

According to the proposal, EIP-4444 will allow nodes to prune old historical data (down to approximately 36 days). This will massively reduce the disk space needed. Long term data will live in a distributed storage network meaning that running a node won't need a datacenter anymore.

Regarding the Stateless clients, it aims to let nodes verify blocks without keeping the whole state. This will also slash storage more and open a door to a new best called ""partially stateless nodes"". These nodes basically will keep only the parts of the state you care about like active EOAs, ERC20/721 contracts or DeFi apps and can still respond to local RPCs. I like thinking of them like little substations or satellites.

This proposal comes because Vitalik is worried about only increasing the L1 gas limit that can compromise node usability but with this new approach Ethereum could 10-100x throughput without centralizing around mega nodes or third party RCPs.

Some will ask, why not rely on ZK-EVMs, etc? Well, this proposal removes the need of depending on third parties and still scale. This is a common practice in software engineering, trying to rely the less in third parties to have full control of what you have.

What do you think? Are you excited to see it running?

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000?. Ethereum is now trading at a pivotal juncture after days of consistent selling pressure that have pushed the price down by more than 12% since last Tuesday. Currently hovering around the $2,400 mark, ETH is struggling to maintain bullish momentum, and many analysts warn that a deeper correction could follow if bulls fail to defend this crucial support zone. The recent drop reflects broader market uncertainty, with rising volatility shaking investor confidence just as ETH appeared ready to join a wider altcoin breakout. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours Despite this weakness, there’s growing optimism in some corners of the market. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis showing that a Golden Cross has been confirmed on Ethereum’s 12-hour chart — a signal traditionally viewed as a precursor to major bullish moves. This crossover, which occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average, often marks the beginning of an extended uptrend. If bulls manage to hold current levels and reclaim higher resistance near $2,600, the Golden Cross could become a turning point. Until then, the coming days will be critical in determining whether Ethereum can bounce or sink into a longer consolidation phase. Volatility Hits Ethereum Amid Golden Cross Signal Ethereum saw sharp volatility over the weekend, surging past $2,550 before rapidly reversing and falling back into the $2,400 zone within hours. This sudden move has sparked renewed uncertainty, as analysts grow cautious about the fading bullish momentum and rising selling pressure. While ETH remains one of the stronger performers in the broader altcoin market, it is still down 36% from its December high of around $4,100. This leaves bulls with a clear challenge: hold current levels and regain control by pushing prices above $2,800 to ignite a sustained rally. The $2,400 level is now acting as a critical support zone. A break below it could trigger a deeper retracement, likely dragging Ethereum into a consolidation range or even toward lower support levels. Still, technical signals offer a glimmer of hope. According to Pillows, Ethereum recently confirmed a Golden Cross on the 12-hour chart — a bullish pattern that occurs when the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average. Historically, such signals have preceded strong upside moves, and Pillow believes this one could pave the way for Ethereum to reach $3,000 in the near term. However, for that to happen, buyers must step in decisively. Volume has tapered off, and sentiment appears fragile after last week&#8217;s breakdown. If bulls can defend the $2,400 region and reclaim higher resistance quickly, the Golden Cross might mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next leg up. Until then, the market remains in a wait-and-see mode, watching whether the bullish signal can outweigh the growing pressure from sellers. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound ETH Tests Key Support After Drop From Local Highs Ethereum is trading at $2,402 after a sharp Sunday sell-off, where the price spiked to $2,670 before retracing more than 10% in less than 24 hours. As seen in the 4-hour chart, ETH is now consolidating right above the $2,390–$2,400 zone, a level that is proving critical for bulls to hold. This area coincides with a prior consolidation zone and could act as a short-term support base. The 200-period EMA on the 4H chart is currently at $2,130, and the 200 SMA is near $1,991 — both are significantly below the current price and offer long-term trend support. However, the volume profile shows a spike in sell-side activity during the pullback, suggesting that short-term traders are locking in profits. If price breaks below $2,390, a deeper retrace toward the $2,200–$2,300 range becomes likely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates Below ATH – Buying Pressure Weakens As Equities Outperform On the upside, ETH must reclaim $2,550 to reestablish momentum. Failure to do so could confirm a local top. The price action is clearly indecisive, and this range-bound structure could persist unless bulls reassert strength with a decisive move above $2,600. Until then, the $2,400 level remains a battleground between buyers and sellers amid elevated volatility. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0659463118580765,

2025-05-20T01:16:01.798473+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent?. The Dogecoin price could be at a critical juncture for a breakout but momentum needs to persist. On the four-hour chart shared by analyst Josh Olszewicz, price has been sliding inside a clearly defined falling-wedge formation since printing a local high at $0.25941 on 13 May. The upper and lower boundaries of that wedge continue to drift lower, trapping successive swing highs and lows; the lower rail is presently guiding support at while the upper rail caps the market near $0.219. Within that compression, Olszewicz overlays an Ichimoku system set to short-cycle parameters (20/60/120/30). The most recent completed candle — stamped 17 May 08:00 UTC — settled at $0.21532 after trading between $0.21187 and $0.21676. That close left price lodged squarely inside the cloud, a location that typically denotes equilibrium. Internally, the Tenkan-sen rests at $0.21427, the Kijun-sen at $0.22524, Senkou Span A at $0.22102 and Senkou Span B at $0.21184, creating an unusually tight band of short-term reference levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tops Tend To Follow Surges In Retail Futures Activity, Analysis Shows The zone between the wedge floor and Span B around $0.212–0.214 forms a high-confluence support zone that has already produced two intraday rebounds. Conversely, the Kijun-sen and descending wedge resistance intersect near $0.225, erecting an equally visible ceiling overhead. As long as price remains trapped between those two lines, momentum traders are likely to see a low-volatility coil; the first decisive breach — particularly a four-hour close through the upper rail — would satisfy every textbook criterion for a bullish falling-wedge resolution and mechanically projects a return toward the 13 May high. Dogecoin Looks Still Strong Cantonese Cat’s weekly perspective speaks to a larger cycle. In his chart, Dogecoin has just finished its first weekly close above the Bull Market Support Band — essentially the 20-week simple moving average enveloped by a two-sigma envelope — since early February. That band currently spans $0.21617 at the lower edge to $0.22378 at the upper edge; last week’s candle settled at $0.22387, a whisker above the cap, converting what had been resistance throughout the spring into provisional support. The break occurs while the Bollinger upper band is still descending from the February crest near $0.35, an indication that volatility on the weekly time-frame has only just begun to contract after a multi-month bear unwind. The midline of the Bollinger structure, identical to the 20-week SMA and the top of the Bull Market Support Band, is therefore the single most important pivot for the week ahead. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pullback May Be Short-Lived—Here’s The Next Price Target A second consecutive weekly settlement above $0.22378 would confirm the first as more than a one-off spike and could embolden trend-followers to price in a medium-term push toward the mid-$0.30s where the upper band presently curves. Taken together, the two time-frames sketch a clear roadmap. Short-term traders will be looking for a resolution of the descending wedge; a bullish breakout through $0.219 would immediately shift focus to prior supply at $0.24-0.26, whereas a failure to hold $0.205 risks an acceleration toward the April pivot at $0.185. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.217. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0654393939393939,

2025-05-20T16:21:40.043339+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

SOL price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above the $172 zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $165 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $172 resistance zone. Solana Price Recovers Above $165 Solana price formed a base above the $160 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL gained pace for a move above the $162 and $165 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $167 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $172 resistance zone. The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 swing high to the $160 low is acting as a resistance. Solana is now trading above $168 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $172 level. The next major resistance is near the $176 level. The main resistance could be $180. A successful close above the $180 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $172 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $168 zone. The first major support is near the $165 level. A break below the $165 level might send the price toward the $162 zone. If there is a close below the $162 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

2025-05-20T16:27:28.779187+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T16:52:55.732505+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T17:18:47.910595+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

2025-05-20T17:37:05.570475+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T18:16:35.276226+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T18:59:34.361164+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T18:59:34.361164+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T19:03:04.701220+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T19:03:04.701220+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T19:12:26.764424+00:00,Ethereum,Reddit,"Ethereum (ETH) Throughput Is Going Parabolic - 78.82M Gas/sec Proves Scaling Is No Longer Just a Theory

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T19:12:26.764424+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

Just crossed with this Leon metrics [Tweet](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1924458967335583891) showing that Ethereum is going parabolic!

https://preview.redd.it/vdbu0ffpxv1f1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e979637fe326b1d50d417b64f497baad9157b24

As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum's throughput is going parabolic and its not just hype! Ethereum network recently has hit a record breaking of 78.82 million gas per second which is a massive leap forward in its computational capacity. This is not just processing more transactions per second, it is about handling more complex operations across the entire ecosystem.

For those who dont know what throughput measures, it measures how much actual computation Ethereum can perform at any given moment. This includes smart contract executions, rollups, NFT minting, DeFi protocol logic, etc. This directly translates to faster performance and lower transaction fees for users and developers.

For how Ethereum is built, this is not only happening in the L1 it is also happening in L2s because of how upgrades are spread. Ethereum is quickly evolving into a highly scalable and efficient base layer for Web3.

It is creating the base for a future where on chain applications are as seamless and cost effective as using traditional web apps.

The all time high in throughput is more than just a number, it is a sign of real progress. Ethereum is scaling is not just a theory anymore, it is happening and this is how a decentralized network levels up.

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

All of us have a price in mind that would carve us out of the crypto markets and into lavish living (though there are no doubt some who think bitcoin will matter in a post-electric world and that electronic currency will somehow outlast physical currency and the concept of trade). With World War 3 approaching swiftly with America's swan dive into fascism, what is your exit number? From an actual value-behind-the-currency, we've already seen the USD get downgraded as the world finally realizes that ""vibes""are not a long-store of value.

2025-05-20T20:45:01.205675+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T20:45:01.205675+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,

The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices.

2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T21:11:16.499290+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T21:45:01.761114+00:00,Solana,News,"Solana Rejected From Key ‘Inflection Point’, But Multi-Year Trend Suggests New Highs. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed crucial levels amid its price rally, recording its highest range in months. However, as the market’s recovery takes a pause, the cryptocurrency has hit a key level that could propel or delay its surge to new highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Solana Rally Faces Key Barrier Solana’s price has significantly surged over the past several weeks, recovering from April’s pullback and breaking out of its downtrend. After its January all-time high (ATH), SOL retraced up to 63%, hitting a 14-month low of $95 last month. However, Solana climbed above some crucial ranges during the late April market recovery, reclaiming the $140 resistance as support for the first time in two months. Since then, the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30% to the $180 mark, recording a three-month high of $183 last week before retracing to the $170 support. Crypto Trader Mercury noted that Solana reached a “very HTF infection point,” which could send the cryptocurrency’s price to new ATHs again if reclaimed. However, the market slowdown has stalled SOL’s rally, with its price falling to the $165-$170 range over the weekend. After its recent performance, the trader added that SOL was rejected from the key inflection point “just enough to allow for a retest of the same trend that got us here in the first place.” Based on this, he considers that reclaiming the $180 mark and eventual breakout to news ATHs is on the horizon, “as long as that 4H 200MAs trend holds.” Meanwhile, analyst Cas Abbé pointed out that Solana’s multi-year trend remains intact despite the recent pullbacks. As he explained, the cryptocurrency is over 50% up from its multi-year ascending trendline retest, seemingly marking the bottom for Solana. The analyst considers that SOL January ATH could not be the top, and another record-breaking rally could come this year. Similarly, trader Coinvo highlighted the ascending trendline, “If SOL continues to hold this trendline, it’s going much higher!” SOL eyes $200 Breakout Over the weekend, analyst Rekt Capital asserted that Solana has broken into its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range on the monthly timeframe, successfully retesting the $120-$135 range as support over the past couple of months. This key higher timeframe retest propelled the cryptocurrency to revisit the $165-$175 range’s high. However, he explained that Solana must break above the upper boundary to confirm a breakout and continue ascending, which it failed to do during last week’s close. SOL also must break and retest the upper boundary as a new support with a Weekly Close above this mark to exit the key range. Additionally, the analyst pointed out that previous performance suggests a price breakout could happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? According to its Q4 2024 price action, if Solana builds a base around the Range high’s resistance, there’s a high chance for the price to rally. The analyst added that a successful breakout from this zone could send SOL’s price to the $200-$210 mark. “SOL simply needs stability here at the Range High resistance, as that would telegraph that this is an area that is becoming support,” Rekt capital concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $165, a 3.1% decline in the daily timeframe. Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",0.0523131313131313,
2025-05-20T21:45:01.761114+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Can Dogecoin Price Reach $0.7 Again? What The Volume Trend Says. The Dogecoin price has failed to reach its all-time high peaks after repeated rallies and subsequent beat downs. So far, it has been a dance between testing major resistance levels, and bulls trying to hold support as sell-offs mount. During this time, there has been a lot of fluctuations in the volume of the meme coin. Using historical performance, the Dogecoin trading volume could give a hint for where the price could be headed next. DOGE Trading Volume Still Trending Low The Dogecoin trading volume has been trending low as the Dogecoin price has retraced over the last few months. This has culminated in a fluctuating market as investors remain very cautious when it comes to the market and meme coins like DOGE have suffered as a result. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Resistance In View: Why The Key Lies At $0.25 According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume has not been able to even hit half of where it was back in November 2024 when the market was pumping. If anything, the decline has been consistent, with spikes here and there as the Dogecoin price fluctuated. As of May 19, the total DOGE derivatives trading volume was sitting at a mere $6 billion. Compared to the $60.11 billion peak that was recorded back in November 2024, the derivatives volume is down my around 90% since then. There was a small spike in the volume to above $10 billion back on May 13 as DOGE bulls had pushed for higher prices. However, this was short-lived as another round of sell-offs has sent the price spiraling again, pushing the trading volume back down in response. What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T22:45:01.975871+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

What This Could Mean For The Dogecoin Price Historically, the increase in the derivatives trading volume have often coincided with the rise in the token’s price. This is visible throughout the years, and quite prominent in 2021, when the meme coin recorded its current all-time high above $0.7. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Tests Panic Zone At $0.21, Breakdown Could Lead To Price Crash Currently, with the derivatives volume still trending low, it could translate to lower levels for the Dogecoin price. Mostly, crypto traders are skewed toward shorting when it comes to betting on the Dogecoin price, leading to the suppression. For this to change, there would have to be a definite change in the Dogecoin trading volume, akin to what was seen back in November 2024. If the volume is able to at least get back above $30 billion, then it is possible for the Dogecoin price to break toward $0.5. However, a break above the $0.7 all-time high would require even much larger figures. Despite the volume beating the 2021 peak of $24.82 billion, the Dogecoin price still did not cross $0.5. This suggests much higher buying pressures than 2021 are required to send the Dogecoin price above $0.7 once more. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",0.0255136268343815,

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T23:14:46.327556+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Range-Bound Ethereum Sees Volatility – High Timeframe Levels Hold The Key. Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious. Ethereum Bulls Hold Structure But Momentum Cools Ethereum bulls gained traction earlier this month when the price surged above the $2,200 level with ease, establishing a bullish structure for the first time in weeks. Momentum accelerated quickly, with ETH breaking through $2,550 on Sunday before retracing just as fast into the $2,400 zone. The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-20T23:45:02.043946+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

The rapid up-and-down action highlights the current uncertainty in the market, where investors remain cautious despite recent strength. The Sunday pullback added weight to analyst warnings that Ethereum could face short-term selling pressure before confirming the next leg up. While many remain bullish on ETH’s medium-term trajectory, they acknowledge that momentum has cooled and the market is pausing to reassess. Daan provided insights into Ethereum’s behavior, describing the price action as “pretty messy” over the past two weeks. He pointed out that ETH, like Bitcoin and the broader crypto market cap, is currently trapped in a tight range. According to Daan, he’s “not looking to do much until we at least convincingly break out of this local range.” The defined range sits between $2,100 (key support) and $2,800 (major resistance). If Ethereum holds above current levels and pushes past $2,800, it could trigger a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Until then, consolidation may persist.

ETH Consolidates Below Resistance As Bulls Hold The Line Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,539 after a volatile week marked by strong bullish attempts and growing resistance pressure. The daily chart shows ETH attempting to hold above the 200-day EMA ($2,440.71), which has now turned into a short-term support zone. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits higher at $2,701.31, acting as a key resistance level Ethereum must overcome to confirm a sustained rally. After a sharp rally in early May that propelled ETH from under $2,000 to above $2,700, the price has entered a period of consolidation. This pause comes after multiple failed attempts to break and hold above the $2,700 resistance, just under the 200SMA. Volume has decreased, and the recent price action suggests a battle between bulls trying to defend the $2,500 level and bears pressing to cap upside moves. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Activity Spikes – 80 Million ADA Added In 48 Hours The bullish structure remains intact as long as ETH stays above the 200EMA and within the $2,400–$2,600 range. However, a failure to maintain current support could expose Ethereum to a deeper retracement toward $2,200. For bulls, reclaiming $2,700 is essential to unlock the next leg higher toward the psychological $3,000 level. Until then, traders should expect choppy price action and tightening volatility.

2025-05-21T00:45:10.100895+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"Metamask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, and Keplr all drained few days ago (May 16th).

# I just want to know how someone was able to gain entry into my 4 individual wallets, with full access to transfer all of my assets.

Preface: I haven't touched/traded any 'airdropped' coins that appear in my wallets, I have NEVER shared my seed phrase, **I haven't connected any of my wallets to any websites in the last few days before this occured**, and when I do, I always double check that the domain is correct, and not is not a phishing link, and then I always revoke access afterwards.

**METAMASK** \- Prior to my account being completely drained, I hadn't used any of my accounts that day, then I suddenly got an alert on my phone that my coins were being swapped into ETH, and a total of **0.0535 ETH was sent at 33:12:59 PM UTC to** **0x162 883e75c20Cf01B5C113B60281c4754CE6906t**,.The same address also swapped coins in order to transfer **0.0271 BNB at 11:12:59 UTC**. Utilizing Mimic:Swapper - (if that's relevant) - to completely drain my portfolio before I could react.

**TRUST WALLET** \- The draining of my XRP was baffling to me as the account hasn't been touched in over 1 year,  it is essentially dormant and I had forgotten about it, and it had 0 active connections. **8.9998 XRP** was stolen, transferred to: **rHUrpwzbtYJwRQrUqbiHbR5c5f4Kx3udGk at 4:10:50 UTC** with **their name being ""register""**. **The account was activated at 4:10:31 UTC**.

**Would that mean that it took 18 seconds after the account's creation to drain my XRP?**

**PHANTOM** \- Coins were swapped to Solana and **1.548827152 SOL** was sent to: **7SPPzzfa9KUWgM3jxdiRhY9xMBy5uq1ZcEGBAmjESUiV at 23:03:13 UTC**, sadly that's not all  that was stolen from my Phantom wallet. They also **transferred 0.00137** **Bitcoin at 15:53:12 UTC to: bc1qv9cluzqr6rt2agcztdxcmn6p9r7lvfm0lgh5qf** (not sure if important) - ""order to allow arbitrage bots to trade against the RAMM, it is useful to have a price estimation feature, that would have parameters similar to RAMMSuiPool.tradeAmounttradeAmountInEstimatePrice""

**KEPLR** \- Confuses me the most, as I don't interact with much on this account, I haven't received any airdrops, I just use it to primarily stake, vote, and utilize LP's (that's how they were able to drain this wallet's funds), **transferring 100 Akash** from my account of at **23:48:57 UTC** and sent to: **osmo10a3k4hvk37cc4hnxctw4p95fhscd2z6h2rmx0aukc6rm8u9qqx9smfsh7u**, they attempted to start un-staking all of the coins in my portfolio, which I cancelled, but am unable to cancel the un-delegation of all of my staked Akash.

I have a semi-hypothesis, though it may sound naïve. Say one of my wallets was compromised, and it was imported into another wallet, would they then have full access all to the pre-existing accounts/wallets that the compromised account was imported into? And if so, would deleting said compromised account from wallet change anything?

Yes I am an idiot, feel free to laugh in the comments, I just would like to hear the communities thoughts on how this occurred. It's safe to say that I will be purchasing a Ledger moving forward.

2025-05-21T00:45:10.100895+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Breakout Expected Within The Next 7 Days: Analyst. The daily Dogecoin/USDT chart published on X by Bitcoinsensus depicts the memecoin locked in a textbook bullish reversal that has been six months in the making. Dogecoin Breakout Within 7 Days? Price action stretching from last October’s vertical rally to the present has carved a broad descending trend line that caps every major swing-high: first the December spike just above $0.48, then a second, lower reaction high in mid-January around $0.43 and a third touch 10 days ago at roughly $0.26. That trend-line is still intact, but—crucially—it now sits only a few percentage points above the market. Within that larger down-trend, Bitcoinsensus highlights an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern whose left shoulder bottomed near $0.142 in mid-March, whose head extended to roughly$0.141 at the start of April, and whose right shoulder formed in early May at about $0.164. The neckline of that structure is not horizontal; it falls modestly from left to right and intersects the chart marginally above $0.185. The analyst marks the 8 May daily candle with a red circle labelled “Breakout,” signalling that the minimum technical requirement for pattern confirmation has already been met. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Since that breakout, Dogecoin has retraced in what the analyst calls a healthy manner. The pull-back has so far respected the neckline, transforming it from resistance into first-layer support. Bitcoinsensus’ projected path, drawn in white, envisages one further dip that tags the long-term trend-line—now lurking near the $0.23–0.24 area—before momentum reverses upward. The forecast gives the market a seven-day window to complete that retest and launch a fresh advance. “Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout. The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation,” the analyst writes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready To Howl? Falling Wedge Breakout Hints At A Rally If the trend-line gives way, the next test would be a grey “Supply Zone” boxed between $0.42 and $0.43, an area that coincides with the January distribution range and the second anchor point of the descending trend-line. “Next Target will be the supply zone at around $0.42-$0.43 per DOGE. Expect a fast move up once the breakout is in full force,” the analyst adds. A decisive daily close inside that band would, in classical chart-theory terms, establish the first higher-high on a major timeframe since November and open the door to a broader trend reversal. Invalidation remains straightforward. A daily settlement back below the neckline—effectively the $0.185 handle—would negate the inverted head-and-shoulders structure and leave the March/April lows vulnerable. Until then, the technical bias skews higher, and the clock on Bitcoinsensus’ seven-day breakout thesis is ticking. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.221.

Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,500 mark after a volatile two-week stretch marked by heavy resistance and indecisive price action. While bulls have successfully defended key support levels, ETH continues to struggle against the supply wall just below $2,800. The broader crypto market mirrors this sideways trend, with Bitcoin and total market cap also trapped within tight ranges, limiting bullish momentum across the board. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Analysts are growing optimistic about the potential for an altseason — but only if Ethereum can convincingly reclaim the $3,000 level. A decisive breakout above that mark would signal renewed strength and likely spark a broader rally in altcoins, many of which have lagged behind in recent weeks. Top analyst Daan shared a technical breakdown, noting that Ethereum’s price action has been volatile over the past two weeks. He emphasized that ETH is currently range-bound, much like BTC and the rest of the crypto market. Until there’s a clear breakout from this local structure, traders remain cautious.

2025-05-21T02:45:02.605584+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum’s Revenge: Arthur Hayes Predicts Run To $10,000. In a macro-focused interview with the Bankless podcast, Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO and current Maelstrom CIO, laid out his bullish thesis on Ethereum, arguing that a move to $10,000 or even $15,000 is a realistic outcome as global liquidity shifts and capital controls take hold in the next monetary regime. Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,” he said. “It’s just human nature.” For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running&#8230; it was time.” Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. “It’s great it’s going up, but okay—let’s talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let’s talk when it’s meaningful.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum’s rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary “phase shift”—a transition away from the US Treasury as the world’s reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. “They print the money,” he said bluntly. “And the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.” Still, Ethereum’s path won’t be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH’s underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH’s moment is coming—particularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 – Here’s Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. “If you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,” he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is “a hard slog” now—yet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. “Mailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it&#8217;s physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That&#8217;s it,” Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there’s even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE 🔥#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout💹 The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next… pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it’s still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn’t spiked yet, so the setup isn’t sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There&#8217;s no way I couldn&#8217;t take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv — Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a “twofold rally” from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That’s about 114% higher. He’s confident there’s “no way you won’t take a Dogecoin trade” if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‑and‑shoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that’s capped gains since December’s $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42–$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100–104% jump from today’s price. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView",0.1057779275232105,

2025-05-21T05:45:01.770454+00:00,Ethereum,News,"Ethereum Market Shows Signs Of Overheating Near $2,500 – Is A Short-Term Pullback Coming?. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the $2,500 mark, signs of market exhaustion are beginning to emerge. Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH’s total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble&#8217;s size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups &#8211; Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum’s ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset&#8217;s market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum&#8217;s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum’s impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset’s future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH’s 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ​​In another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle’s upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum’s daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from CryptoQuant, X, and TradingView.com",0.0935912698412698,

2025-05-21T05:45:01.770454+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest. Dogecoin has entered a critical phase as it consolidates below the $0.26 resistance level, facing rising pressure after a sharp rejection last week. Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.

2025-05-21T06:45:01.817702+00:00,Dogecoin,News,"Dogecoin Momentum Fades – Analyst Expects $0.213 Retest. Dogecoin has entered a critical phase as it consolidates below the $0.26 resistance level, facing rising pressure after a sharp rejection last week. Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling.

The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone.

However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",0.0619864341085271,

This whole process is fucking convoluted and searching for answers leads me in circles.

I have pull up the Reddit Vault in Metamask (While having Arbitrum Nova selected)... I can see my moons.  If I choose Arbitrum One, then I can't see the Moons.  Tried sending them to Kraken, but ""Insufficient Gas"" was displayed.  Ok, so I funded my wallet with $10 worth of ETH to my Metamask from Robinhood and it doesn't show up in the Arbitrum Nova tab... but if I switch the Ethereum Mainnet, it does show up.

So, Same account in the same wallet, but only accessible on different chains?  I don't understand the workflow.  I thought funding my wallet would allow access to my ETH to use as gas for my moon transfer, but alas, I guess I'm missing a step.

I googled and the AI said that I need to bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Nova (chain my Moons are on).  Ok, I guess that kinda makes sense.  Tried to bridge and Arbitrum Nova isn't even on this list for bridging in Metamask.... to top it off, the AI said I might need gas to do the bridging, which fuckin seems like cyclical logic cause I can't access the arbitrum nova chain that I was originally trying to send ETH to.",0.1107142857142857,
2025-05-21T08:45:01.789664+00:00,Ethereum,News,"$3.8 Billion In Capital Inflows Behind Ethereum’s Post-Pectra Surge, Data Shows. On-chain data shows Ethereum has seen a significant rise in its Realized Cap recently, signaling the incoming of capital into the asset. Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade&#8217;s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the &#8216;real&#8217; value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric&#8217;s value goes down, it&#8217;s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn&#8217;t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. &#8220;Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) &#8211; but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week. Featured image from Dall-E, Glassnode.com, chart from TradingView.com",-0.0145701198026779,
2025-05-21T08:45:01.789664+00:00,Solana,Reddit,"SEC Extends Review of Solana ETF Filings, Opens Public Comment

  
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has [delayed](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2025/34-103063.pdf) its decision on two Solana-based ETF proposals submitted by 21Shares and Bitwise. The agency is reviewing the filings and has opened a public comment period to gather input from market participants.

Furthermore, the SEC seeks feedback on the Canary Solana Trust and VanEck Solana Trust. While the moves do not signal approval or rejection, they indicate the regulator’s intent to further examine the legal and policy considerations.

  
*Background Behind the Delay*

The SEC’s decision to extend the review period reflects its intent to gather additional information on pricing mechanisms and asset custody. 21Shares and Bitwise submitted their filings for Solana ETFs earlier this year, while similar applications from Canary and VanEck followed in late April 2025.

The delay comes amid a growing wave of ETF proposals tied to a broad range of crypto assets, from flagship tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to memecoins and NFTs. Products linked to SOL, XRP, DOGE, and even projects like Pudgy Penguins are now under the Commission’s scrutiny.
